Occacionaly you look over to your healthbar to the right border of your screen and be like - oh when did my health get soo low and how??!!.\n\n2 Bucks is not much money asked and there is content but its NOT worth your time at version 20 right now!\nIt has potential but also a loong way ahead of itself and i doubt it will ever reach its full potential because fundamentaly (technicaly) this game is not good. Good luck.", "label": 0}
