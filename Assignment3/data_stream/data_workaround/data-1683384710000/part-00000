{"review_id": "137878208", "app_id": "1294810", "review_text": "The game is just a mess. I mean honestly,  the world is just empty. Even the main missions are absolute bollocks. Just not a fun experience at all. And all that with such a pricetag is just insulting to the player. And im not going to start on all the bugs, absolute stupid gameplay mechanics, the situation that you need an active internet connection for a single player game. I gave the game 3 hours. Thats time i will never get back in my life. \nJust dont buy this mess of a game. There are definetly better options for you to spend ypur money on.", "label": 0}
