The game's closer to Chimera Squad than X-Com proper - the cast of characters is small with each one having specific weapon type and unique abilities, combat encounteres are fast but numerous, there is no strategic meta-game on top, instead in between fights you do some light exploration and encounter some environmental puzzles. While surviving the fights on its own usually isn't too difficult, many arenas provide some optional objectives or complications that make things more challenging and interesting. I honestly think that thanks to being so straightforward, Showgunners may be a good introduction to the genre for someone who didn't play turn-based tactical games before. And to top it off, soundtrack is absolutely on point.", "label": 1}
{"review_id": "137881705", "app_id": "1669000", "review_text": "The game is fun. love the fact you can customize your ruler and have them as a hero that evolves alongside your people. the combat is fun and has a satisfying tactical element to it. the campaign side is also not as much of a drag as other 4x games that implement similar mechanics. like grievances from humankind as an example.\n\nThat being said. the naval combat is bare bones. The multiplayer is very slow as no one can do anything on the campaign map as long as someone is in combat. this is a huge problem in the middle to late game when fights are bigger and take longer. if these things get fixed, then it would be one of the best 4x games of all time in my opinion.", "label": 1}

{"review_id": "137881642", "app_id": "1669000", "review_text": "I finally decided to take the plunge because I've always been interested in strategy/tactical/4X games but mainly because I'm done with the modern-day gaming industry; specifically the triple AAA industry. I've had it with microtransactions being pushed down my throat and content being locked behind a pay wall that should just be in the base game from the start. \n\nOver the last few years, my passion for gaming was dying because I thought it was due to me growing up and responsibilities being the main focus in my life now. Every game I tried from the big developers are either broken on release, filled with microtransactions, or a boring and repetitive gameplay experience rehashed in a next gen game (I'm looking at you Ubisoft). I really wanted to rekindle my love for gaming again and I struck gold with AoW 4!\n\nSuper satisfied with this game! It's my first 4X experience and it's definitely overwhelming for me. However, I've never had so much fun playing a game again. I love the fantasy setting, the xcom-style combat is engaging, and micro-managing my cities & armies is something I thought would be tedious at first but is actually an enjoyable gameplay loop. Can't wait to sink more hours into this game and get lost in the lore and universe.\n\n\n\n", "label": 1}
