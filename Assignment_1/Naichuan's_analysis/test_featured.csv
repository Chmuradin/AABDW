I'm renting my room in the EU district, within walking distance to European Institutions, and to the underground Schuman. The place is shared with three other people. It is located right next to Place Jourdan, famous among locals for its Sunday market, vivid restaurants and top Belgian fries-house Antoine and  brasseries! The flat is also a stone-throw away from the beautiful Park Jacqmain, providing a great residential feeling while you're at the very heart of the leading business and European political area. We've been getting around using Airbnb as a way of accommodation and to meet inhabitants. It always has been a pleasant experience. Hope you will be my guest and have fun in the Capital of Europe :-) !   ------------- Beginning of the adventure in Airbnb in 2013 ----------------------------  Dear Host,  Here comes year-around-big-travel for us, my boyfriend and me :) I just finished my two years master study and am making up for all the travel missed out since my last stop at Hongkong in 2011, absolutely wonderful, thanks to two local guides ;-) NYC is THE place I've always been dreaming to go, I have finished the Routard reading during my session, and am really looking forward to discover the city at the local pace :-)  Our stay would probably last from 15/08 to 22/08 morning, then we'll head to Montreal, Canada another favorite place of mine :-).   ====UPDATE 2014-07-01====== I'm working at a database IT consultancy firm and soon for a company in Maastricht for >4 mth, and I have started learning Dutch for a while now. I've always been very interested in living in Flemish/Dutch areas so to learn the language and communicate with Flemish/Dutch people in their own social codes :-).

I have been living here for the last 40 years (gosh, I can't believe I can say that), which means that I know Brussels quite well. And I love it. Actually I love big busy cities like London, New-York or Paris, and even though Brussels is way smaller, there is really something to it.  I am a webdesigner and I run my own company which I launched nearly 12 years ago. This means that I love art and design. My wife being a photographer and me loving to shoot videos, we are very much into visual art and communication.   Like yourself (so I guess) we also like to travel. Visiting large cities, as I mentioned, but also going to quiet places. Our trip to Bali a few years back was really mind blowing and made on us a powerful impression.  What I like most in Brussels is all the things you can do. It is not such a big city, but there are always events taking place like exhibitions, music festivals, street events, shows and celebrations. Moreover thanks to the combination of cultures and ethnicities, you never get bored. Another key aspect is the restaurants, there are plenty of neighborhoods in the city center or around it packed with small and cosy restaurants.   I think Brussels is really worth a visit and I'll be happy to give you a few tips (only if so you wish).",within an hour,100.0,1,1,"email, phone, reviews, manual_offline, jumio",2,3,30,8,25,51,124,moderate,81,2011-10-16,2017-05-02,98.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,10.0,1.2,"Host Is Superhost, Host Has Profile Pic, Host Identity Verified, Is Location Exact, Instant Bookable",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.07572058529823518,-0.02030473591224124,0.003367347162653596,-0.0009285406504534825,-0.010606065279596018,-0.08147589313665168,0.07989664206297702,0.009889619932058653,-0.07317212442253807,0.00668586513027257

We have created a real garden - vegetable garden on the terrace that gives us great satisfaction as soon as spring arrives and that nature takes its course.  Laszlo is a daily cyclist and Isabelle rolls scooter and uses public transport. Tibor is a school of quartier.Nous have moved there in 2010 and we know better our neighborhood. Every year we organize the Neighbours Day, allowing us to meet and get to know neighbors. Saint Gilles is very active from a cultural point of view. There are many socio-cultural projects and artists, what we like.  Brussels is a multicultural city full of exciting neighborhoods, each with its own identity. Our neighborhood is young and friendly. The apartment has the advantage of being close to public transport very cheap in Brussels. As in many European cities, you can also rent bikes across Brussels to move ((URL HIDDEN)  We like to make mini trip to Europe and have already traveled to other continents. We appreciate discover other cultures.Nous we ventured in 2014 in Asia for a four-month trip with our 5 year old son. We lived an exciting and unforgettable experience.
