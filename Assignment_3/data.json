I'm struggling to get 60fps even without ray tracing and i'd say wait a few weeks to pick this one up. hopefully it'll have a few updates in it by then and everyone can enjoy this great game.", "label": 0}, {"review_id": "137466813", "app_id": "1748750", "review_text": "[h1]tl;dr[/h1]\nAt its core, this game is a birthday cake. It's sweet and sugary and the experience of eating it is one of unfettered, pure joy, however, there isn't a lot of nutritional value if you're looking for a meal rather than the joy of eating cake.\n\nYou will see a lot of the word 'joyful' in this review -- I can think of no other better way to sum up this game. Sorry for the repetition.\n\n[h1]Long version:[/h1]\n[b]Graphics/Aesthetics/VFX/OST:[/b]\nBefore anything else, I need to say that this game is absolutely ADORABLE. 'Sugary' doesn't even get nearly close enough to describing how sweet and joyful it is, and I can honestly say that there isn't a single game that's filled me with such pure [b]joy[/b] in the last year. Legitimately, I really can't sum it up better than with the birthday cake analogy, but essentially, this game makes me unreasonably happy playing it. The art style is super cute and the pixel art well-crafted. The colours are pastel enough to be adorable but still diverse enough of a colour pallet to make everything visually distinct. The soundtrack is cutesy, if a bit limited, but that low variation hasn't yet really struck me all that much in my ~5 hours of playing so far today alone. (It really only ever occurred to me when I sat down to write this review.) But above all else, [u][b]oh my god are the sound effects happiness-enducing.[/b][/u] I legitimately don't know what words to use, but there's a soft whimsy to everything that legitimately just does make me feel absolutely joyful all the time while playing. It's serene, it's calming, it's happy, it's wonderful.\n\n[b]Gameplay Mechanics:[/b]\nThat said, the format of this game is very shallow and incremental. I understand that it's an early access game, but the [b]format/structure[/b] of the game itself isn't one that lends itself well to particular depth. The progression comes from upgrading your base, but there are no meaningful choices to be made -- everything is just a straight upgrade to one of dozens of little, low-value skill upgrades. One upgrade may give you increased damage to flying monsters. Another may give you small ticks of health regen during the day time, or heal you after chopping down a tree. Each level of a skill is virtually meaningless with a very, VERY tiny effect. Choosing what decorations to place is less about strategy and optimization and more just \"What resources do I have on-hand/what can I craft right now?\" It's essentially an incremental game as far as the base customization/building, with a cute little fighting game for the main world. There is only a single skill I've found immediately meaningful and impactful, and that's a skill that allowed me to damage an otherwise-invulnerable enemy. However, everything else is just tiny little effects (I have 5 trees, so I restore 5 HP from chopping down trees, but enemy attacks do 15-25 on average. I gain 1 HP every few seconds during daytime, but I have multiple hundreds of total HP.)\n\n[b]Difficulty:[/b]\nI personally suck at this kind of (twinstick?) game, so take my struggles with a grain of salt, but I found MOST enemies trivial, but then bosses to be a SHARP difficulty curve. I think I might have had more luck playing on mouse+keyboard, but I've been playing on Steam Deck, so default controller controls it is. There's an auto-aim feature which is there to help with that, and it's [i]mostly[/i] solid, however I have encountered that sometimes it seems to go a little haywire and randomly jump to the opposite side of the screen from where I'm aiming. This usually happens only once or twice every Giant enemy (basically bigger numbers; more hp sponge, more damage), or 10+ times on the one boss that I managed to kill (across about a dozen attempts), but every time it happens it can range from a nuisance (easy Giant enemies) to lethal (bosses). My suspicion is that it's detecting an off-screen enemy and jumping to them instead randomly, but I honestly don't know why it's doing it or how to fix it. I've fiddled with some settings, but for the most part, I've just come to accept that I'll have to deal with my aim randomly going weird places a couple times per minute of gameplay. It's not a big deal to me personally, but YMMV on that. (And I do believe it's SPECIFICALLY because of the auto-aim feature, so turning that off if I was playing KB+M would probably fix it.)\n\n[h1]Summary:[/h1]\nThis game isn't complete, but what's there is a joy-inducing, beautiful experience. The core gameplay loop is solid, and if you're just looking for a game to pick up periodically for bite-sized chunks of happiness, I think Crystarise is a great option for that. (I could definitely see someone playing it as a stress relief from frustration points in other games, for example.) Even considering early access considerations, I don't really expect to see a whole lot of depth added to the game, but personally, I'm okay with that. I think this game is well-suited to being a bite-sized, shallow, beautiful experience.\n\nNormally, I wouldn't recommend most games lacking depth like Crystarise at $15, but this is actually one place where I think the strength of the joy found in this game conditionally warrants the current price, even in early access with limited content. My personal recommendation is -- [b]IF you are looking for a cutesy, joyful experience and you won't be too upset if there's not a lot of optimization and crunching of game mechanics, Crystarise is absolutely worth your time.[/b] Don't hesitate to pick it up at $15, but also on the same note, if you're not enjoying it within the first 30-60 minutes, also don't hesitate to refund it. You should be able to tell quite quickly what the core gameplay loop is like and whether you will enjoy it enough to consider it worth your time.", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137416122", "app_id": "1774580", "review_text": "So bad optimization. \n\nStuck between 30-40fps regardless if anything is changed (low to epic no difference)\n", "label": 0}, {"review_id": "137627211", "app_id": "2362520", "review_text": "Super fun game!

Now we play as Fuu, a female exorcist who arrived a tad too late to reseal Akame, but just in time to work alongside Aya to deal with the sudden increase of miasma.\n\nThe story has next to no twists this time, but that's compensated by featuring a protagonist interested in sex since it's the quickest way for her to restore the mana she spent on her way to the town.

It features a lot of improvements, such as being able to investigate multiple mysteries simultaneously instead of doing them one by one and getting the items you need highlighted on the map. There's also a new feature I liked a lot which lets you see which person, location, or objects were tainted by the miasma, making it a lot easier to know where to go.\n\nAs for the visuals, the sprites are as nicely-drawn as usual, but the pixel art in the H-scenes is even better now. This time, the sex scenes feature a mix of non-con and consensual scenes instead of being a non-con fest since the main character is more than willing to use sex to get her job done, sometimes taking advantage of her aggressors during the more rapey scenes.

Games like Temtem or Coromon often stay to close to the formula set by Pokemon, ultimately feeling like filler fan games.\nCassette Beasts is different, retaining the simple collectible charm of the genre while innovating in ways that make it something special. \nThe rock paper scissors format has been reinvented so that various effects manifest depending on the interaction (i.e. fire striking plastic causes it to melt into toxic sludge or wind uprooting plant types, causing a debuff). Learning these matchups is greatly beneficial though you will not be overly punished when you make a bad call, just needing to adapt.\nA notorious flaw of the genre is grinding (looking at you Temtem) yet Cassette Beasts has sidestepped this issue in a way I've never seen before in this genre. Here, your character and your partners level up while your Beasts match whatever the level of the character using them is. You can be level 56 go back to capture a rare level 12 Beast you missed early on, and imminently use it in the next boss battle as it will now be your level.\nOn top of the innovations they make, the Beast designs are excellent. Cassette Beasts doesn't follow the usual trend of animal + element and instead makes charming and likable monsters that then have an element/type applied to it that matches its design. These solid designs give way to Cassette Beasts amazing rare color monster system, in which a Beast will change its type to match its new coloration, creating a unique creature that you may never encounter again.\nI haven't even gotten into the npcs, which I'll say little on to not spoil them. All I'll say is that they are wonderful, ranging from classic 80-90s style cartoon goofballs to deeper characters that you feel like you might meet irl.\nI deeply hope this is not the only entry in this series, for the first time in a long while I feel like a WANT to 100% a game.

That isn't to say that nobody new can or will enjoy this game, but like Dead by Daylight (an obvious comparison as a fellow 4v1 asymmetrical horror game,) people who have leveled more will have access to things you don't know how to counter yet.\n\nAdditionally, unlike Dead by Daylight, the \"demon\" side is more of an RTS-type mode wherein you fly around in first person gathering \"energy\" and placing traps/possessing items and people. You are not generally a being with a form. If you've seen any of the Evil Dead series, you're familiar with \"demon cam,\" and this is demon cam as a game.\n\nMeanwhile, for survivors, I find the gameplay of this more similar to Friday the 13th: The Game than I do to Dead by Daylight. First, you loot up for weapons (melee & ranged,) healing (in the form of Shemps Cola,) shields (in the form of blessed amulets,) and in-match skill tree upgrades (in the form of Pink F, found in chests.) Then, you traverse the map (on foot or by car, but the car alerts the demon to your location and is generally used late-game instead,) to find three Map Pieces. After all three are collected, you play a mini-tower-defense game wherein you stand in a circle and fight AI enemies (or enemies possessed by the demon player) to capture the Kandarian Dagger & the Lost Pages of the Necronomicon. Following this, you have a \"boss battle\" type scenario to fight the Dark Ones, and then a two-minute period wherein survivors try to defend the Necronomicon and the demon tries to destroy it. You can fight back, unlike Dead by Daylight, and unlike any other game of its genre, you can respawn your teammates at altars (like vans in Fortnite or beacons in Apex.)\n\nPrior to the Steam release, fans who'd been playing for a while (on Epic and consoles) noticed that something went a lil funny with the MMR and it seems as if the MMR was reset. This means that people who have much higher leveled characters than you do were going against you, and demons levels 46+ were going against survivors on their first game. This has started to level out, but isn't 100% accurate yet.\n\nGenerally, I find this game to be engaging and a lot of fun. There's characters for every possible playstyle (Warriors if you prefer extra melee damage, Hunters if you're good at headshots, Supports if you wish to heal, and Leaders if you wish to apply a variety of buffs to your team,) and all of them have their own unique abilities and skill trees you can level into to build around what you specifically enjoy doing. These are NOT just skins, these are actually different characters... and if you're worried? Every single class has an Ash, so even though characters cannot appear multiple times in the same lobby, you can always play Ash if you'd like to.", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137635956", "app_id": "1324130", "review_text": "A shame really, really wanted to play this.\nMy PC blue screens every time i try to play it, thus the low playtime.\nNo other game causes my PC to blue screen.\n\nRefunded, but may consider purchasing again in the future", "label": 0}, {"review_id": "137484952", "app_id": "1774580", "review_text": "runs very poorly on the biggest steam deck, please fix this as its my only way of playing it since its not on ps4\n", "label": 0}, {"review_id": "137469534", "app_id": "1357210", "review_text": "Only early in the game but what I have seen so far is good.

The story is your average family mystery, the puzzles are fun, and I can't stress just how amazing the art direction is. That alone constitutes a recommendation from me.\nIt has some issues that you can get nagged by right off the bat that I won't deny, namely with pacing and animations. As the pros are really upfront and you already know if you are into them the moment you see them, I will develop on what might make you wait a little bit before you do go into the game.\n\nTo begin with, the introduction to the main character and the storyline is non-existant. There's a very, very brief \"woah, occult things happen! And here's some dude called Benedict. Also use his ghost thing. He has that. Why? Who knows! You are already in combat.\" throw-away intro cutscene and that's it. Obviously this is intended as means for you to feel like you want to discover more about his character and situation, but what actually happens is that it feels rushed and clunkily laid out, which really contrasts with just how pleasant the visuals are. \n\nThere are similar issues along the road;\n-Benedict starts spewing random in-universe technobabble immediately and speaks to the eldritch Companion like he's just an everyday thing to him. You are given no insight to any parts of his character or situation, so you just feel like you arrived late to the show or accidentally skipped some other cutscene somewhere that at least introduced them. (But you didn't.)\n-The voice acting isn't great, to be honest. It's understandable of course, but. You go into the game expecting a noir investigation vibe, you are given the cookie monster's voice telling a scared and uninterested-sounding soft spoken dude to get his * together. \n-Benedict has no \"idle\" animations. Meaning even when you are walking around the normal house areas or tame sectors of the game, he's stuck in a weird... hunched down, shanking-ready position that really feels awkward. There's no sense of phasing between walking around the house or around hostile environments as a result, which for a game with that much detail in its visuals, feels extra jarring.\n-The actual combat animations aren't fluid either, which would at least compensate the above. They are stiff, hard to measure, and basically kind of feel like they weren't exactly thought through.\n-Honestly the whole combat feels like an afterthought. Just from the tutorial fight alone you could assume they wanted to make an investigation game but they elected last minute it should also be able to appeal to people with some hardcore combat approach, and they glued that on top. If it were fluid I am sure it would become fun, but no matter the upgrades you get, the clunkiness is still there.\n-... Unfortunately this applies to the platforming too, and there is a lot of that. Benedict controls terribly, jumps awkwardly, latches onto things with bad accuracy and just seems to overall not be intended to be doing all that he is doing.\n\nMy hope is that all these things will get some polish down the road through some patches, maybe not the voice acting or intro of course as that is a purely personal sentiment, but the animations, platforming and the overall combat sensation do require a heavy brush-up. They are critical for a Metroidvania, and here they really are lacking. If they ever do get fixed up, the game will be effectively amazing.", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137483867", "app_id": "1623940", "review_text": "LITTLE DUDES BE JAMMIN", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137506208", "app_id": "1928420", "review_text": "wth i get no teammates ever even if i have auto team", "label": 0}, {"review_id": "137506642", "app_id": "1623940", "review_text": "Very beautifully done.

There are commonalities however and while everyone has a unique and fun story to tell right now I think it'll be two months before they all begin to sound alike.\n\nWhile you can follow many different interesting threads like tracing phone calls, finger print scanning, checking security tapes etc. \nAll leads however boil down into breaking into a place which hasn't been balanced because of the random nature of it. And to break into a place it will only ever follow 3 paths: 1. Bribe your way in 2. Go in through the vents 3. Disable security and lockpick in, with your limited items and gadgets only helping to slightly even the odds but it isn't enough. \n\nThe dialogue tree isn't versatile enough to feel natural. Speaking to NPCs feels like talking to Morrowind NPCs who have no quests attached to them. They can tell you who they are, who they knows, where places are but not anything of substance or relevance.\n\nThe combat system is incredibly janky and nonfunctional. You can only temporarily stun and render opponents asleep for 2 mins or surprise and cuff them from behind although this approach might bug the game with an unending 'Pursuit' of you.\nGuns feature in the game but you cannot use them and supposedly they won't ever be able to be used because killing NPCs would break the procedurally generated elements. \n\nYou will be discovered, you will die, you will save scum, you'll find out the place you spent hours trying to get into wasn't actually related to the case at all. \nOnly in the tutorial mission will you ever be handed the closest thing the game has to a smoking gun. These cases are incredibly difficult.\n\nSide missions trick you into thinking that a case to find a missing necklace is an easy beginner's case but instead you'll be handed only a fingerprint and an address book with 14+ people in it to sort through. \nA mission like this can take hours and end up being a total waste of money, effort and time.\nOther missions simply say: Arrest this office worker, we don't know where he works, who he is, how old he is, what he looks like, no evidence, just go get him. \nSide missions seem to be a complete afterthought, not as fleshed out as the murder cases yet, not worth the time or effort as of now. \n\nHours of progress can easily be lost and doomspiral until you're out of money, lockpick resources and wanted for more crimes than the criminal you're hunting.\n\nThe game desperately needs more player options for circumventing annoying stonewalls like uncooperative suspects and triple layered security systems for a janitor's broom closet. \n\nAlternate sneaking methods of entry like getting through windows, leveraging police warrants to get into suspect's homes, being able to use limited screwdrivers to disable security cameras from below.\n\nRight now it only barely succeeds as a detective sim and you'll note other reviews of people who simply gave up on the snooping and now treat the game as a Hobo Looting Simulator. \nI'm hoping the devs can patch a few more features into this to fully deliver on the premise.\n", "label": 0}, {"review_id": "137673339", "app_id": "2359850", "review_text": "I like it very hard and very fun\n\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01 \u0e22\u0e32\u0e01\u0e0a\u0e34\u0e1a\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e22 lol", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137487289", "app_id": "1869590", "review_text": "meh", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137555218", "app_id": "1493750", "review_text": "Been wanting this game for a while now, I've always been a fan of the Evil Dead franchise and I think this game really captures the essence of the movies as well as the show.

Tamed beasts can have their passive and active abilities removed and swapped around, stats can be adjusted as well about half way through the game, and you can even hunt for special 'bootleg' variants of every single monster that changes its type as well.

The reason games like the Batman Arkham or Tomb Raider series made you restart item/tool/ability progression was to (1) rebalance those things for the new mechanics, (2) force that progression on you as part of the story telling, (3) they probably could only think of so many new gadgets and things, (4) they wanted to make the abilities or items you get make sense for the story in that moment, etc.  Survivor took the gamble of making entirely new progression tables, and it paid off!\n\nI'll start with the lightsaber stances.  You have single blade and dual-sided blade just like Fallen Order.  But you get three (3) entirely new-to-the-series stances to play with.  If you've seen the trailers, you can likely guess what they are.  I won't name them here, though, for folks that like to stay clear of spoilers.  I will simply say that each one has it's own skill progression to put ability points into.\n\nNext is the force powers.  As stated, you begin with the stuff you ended Fallen Order with, and they remind you how to use them in the early mission.  You are also granted one new ability in that early mission with a line of dialogue mentioning that Cere taught it to you in the time between games.  As you progress, however, you get additional upgrades to your force powers through the mission, or through the skill trees.  There are three force skill trees that allow you to focus on the parts you wish to for your gameplay style.\n\nOld enemies, like Shock Troopers, aren't has difficult to take out as they were in Fallen Order.  Now, that may sound like we nerfed those baddies, but no!  You start stronger, more traveled, more experienced.  There are new enemies that are meant to be harder, so the bad guys you used to fight aren't as hard as they used to be.  It'd be like saying because you got beat up in 3rd grade you can never take on a 3rd grader.  When you are 25 you can probably take down a 3rd grader (PSA: I AM NOT condoning taking down a 3rd grader!).  This makes you feel like an experienced Cal because you remember how hard some of these enemies were, but now they are fodder to you.  It does the intended purpose very well.\n\nSomething I'm not usually a fan of in a lot of games is the companion mechanic.  There are missions where you have a tag-along for support.  This character is specific to that mission and, insofar as I can tell, you cannot change it (perhaps in New Game+, I am only just starting that now, more that in a bit).  My reason for hating companions is that the AI is almost always bad and they just get in the way.  My exception is the way Last Of Us coded companions, especially how they specifically move out of the way if you're walking through a damned door!  In Survivor, the ally you are given isn't even necessarily there for the whole mission.  There are times they break away to do something else for the task at hand and meet back up with you.  They do their own combat stuff, there are cool finishers when they are around, and you they always tend to make sense with their ability for the mission you're on.  That said, I actually like (not love) the companion system in this game.\n\nThis brings me to the side mechanics.  In Fallen Order you basically collected cosmetics and seeds for the ships terrarium.  With Survivor, they took that and brought it bigger.  There are base-allies that provide different types of shops where the currency is a specific collectible you find in the world.  There is a whole-ass garden, as opposed to a few individual seeds.  They brought in a minigame not unlike Gwent from Witcher 3 or Machine Strike in Horizon Forbidden West - with a fun in-galaxy way to collect new pieces.  There's definitely some extra stuff for those 100%ers and side explorers in this one!\n\nAnd finally, New Game+.  In Fallen Order, NG+ was practically an afterthought, as all you really got was all of the cosmetics and then you replayed everything from scratch.  With Survivor, they definitely fixed that.  I have only just started the first mission in NG+, so I won't be speaking too heavily on that, except to say the following: you begin NG+ with all of your perks (new mechanic I didn't even cover), skill points, and cosmetics.  There are story-specific things you aren't given out of the gate, but you can spend your pool of skill points on other things in the meantime and earn more as you progress.  They got this one pretty right, as far as I can tell at the moment.\n\nAll said, the game is getting pretty mixed reviews, but I honestly don't see it.  There is less of the sliding around every level, there are more shortcuts between key mission areas, they even brought in fast travel between meditation points.  The combat mechanics style is still not exactly my thing (locking onto and jumping around an enemy), but it feels far less clunky than Fallen Order did.\n\nOverall, based solely on my first playthrough, and about five minutes of NG+ just to see what it did before heading to bed, I would say Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a solid 8/10 for me.", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137466326", "app_id": "1869590", "review_text": "Nic", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137561011", "app_id": "1869590", "review_text": "\"You can't become the world's best (omega) striker unless you're the world's biggest egoist.\" - that one crazy guy in that anime", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137665787", "app_id": "1294810", "review_text": "Game quality goes down equal to the price going up.\nI can't tell if its Arkane that lost touch or if its the Bethesda overlords that rush things so nothing is ready.\nEither way, this made me loose all hope that Starfield will be even close to playable upon release.", "label": 0}, {"review_id": "137493054", "app_id": "2269330", "review_text": "[h1]Experienced on the Meta Quest 2[/h1]\n\nYou can view my preview gameplay here: https://youtu.be/MSjnv-9GrhA\n\nI did get a free preview copy for this app (including the DLC). It's a mostly 180 3D music video made within a game engine so that it looks 360. There are some simple, unique interactions for each music video such as banging on a drum pad. The whole experience is pretty short though (they are music video length after all). This concert includes music videos for her biggest hits, including: Savage, Th*t Sh*t, Kitty Kat, & Body.\n\nThe visual quality is where this app shines. If you have used Amaze VR in the past, then you know their video rendering quality in VR is among the best. If you're a Megan Thee Stallion fan then other than being at her concert with front row seats, there's probably no better way to experience her concert. I do wish it was longer there with more songs.\n\nIt's a free download with paid DLC. I think the free download shows enough to give you an idea if this is something you'll enjoy. If you're not a Megan Thee Stallion fan this is a tough sell, although if you enjoy cake you'll probably enjoy it too.\n\n[b]Rate ?/10.[/b]\n\n[quote]Please note: I received a free Steam key through the Steam Curator Connect program.

I think I\u2019ve tried most of them at this point, most recently Dinkum, My time at Sandrock, and Kynseed, and while I tried [b]Roots of Pacha[/b]\u2019s Demo some time back I wasn\u2019t sure then that it would be different enough to hold my attention.\n\nSo far (8 hours in) I will say it\u2019s unique enough to carve its own path. Just a few points that stood out to me: \n\n\u2022\tBecause of the time setting (prehistoric), you will have a different approach to things than in, say, Stardew Valley. There are no sprinklers, bus stations, or other modern conveniences. This is for good [i]and[/i] ill. The different take on chores makes for a new experience but might sometimes feel a little bit tedious.\n\u2022\tIn Roots of Pacha, you don\u2019t sell things to make gold. Instead you contribute to your village and through your contributions, your tribe will see new inventions and you yourself will create goodwill that you can trade for items. I absolutely love this. It feels a lot more meaningful than just collecting gold for my own greed\u2019s sake. \n\u2022\tThere\u2019s animal taming and breeding! I was so stoked when I ran into a group of boars and realised I\u2019d be able to tame them, but almost squealed when I found out I\u2019d be able to breed them and that the breeding would give them better stats. While perhaps not the spiritual successor to my breeding programs in ARK, it\u2019s enough to give the game a gold star in my book. The animals also have distinct appearances. My favourite boar is grey with a brown, curly mane. I love pigs, but there are many other animals for you to tame as well. \n\u2022\tThere\u2019s no combat, at least that I\u2019ve found. Instead, in the caves you solve puzzles. This feels refreshing to me and more in line with the chill experience I\u2019m looking for. Usually fighting in these types of games tends to be quite clumsy and uninspired anyway. \n\u2022\tMany tasks are minigames. Fishing, for instance, has you trying to hover your mouse pointer carefully over a fish to catch it. Taming animals means hitting notes when playing a flute. Mind, these are simple, uncomplicated little minigames that won\u2019t likely pose a challenge to most, but I have some concerns that they might grow repetitive as I get further into the game. \n\nAll in all, the game is a clear must-buy for me. Almost every other farming game I\u2019ve tried over the past years (save for Dinkum and Kynseed) were so unoriginal and formulaic that I barely got through the intros. [b]Roots of Pacha[/b] brings something new to the genre and I hope other games follow suit and try to be less derivative. That said, this is still firmly in the genre and some things are less original than others. \n\nIf you\u2019re on the edge, like I was, I suggest you pick it up. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be disappointed. \n", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137672341", "app_id": "2359850", "review_text": "interesting game, unusual old-school design, had fun in the game", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137633811", "app_id": "1277920", "review_text": "Shockingly bad.

It doesn't evolve past gathering things and expanding the island.\n\nThe main progress bottleneck for most players will be the Magenta enemies and their biomes. Reducing damage from cold and heat requires 40 levels of resistances per 1 damage, and the enemies require at least 100 combined levels of Sword Attack / Slayer to deal more than 1 damage to them. You can use DPS skills to take them down faster if you're too impatient to grind for the necessary stats, but expect to take at least a minute to kill them one by one. To see the Lava and Snow bosses will probably demand at least 8 hours of your time slowly killing Magenta enemies. If you're lucky with heart spawns and dungeons, it's possible to spend less time than I did.\n\nThere's a very small range of island customization, consisting of a few palette changes for stores, and biome appearances for plants and rocks. It's possible to make it pretty even with the small item catalogue, but due to the time it takes to expand the island, especially during the Magenta grinding phase, it's very likely your island will consist of a random assortment of rocks, plants, and heart crystals. The \"residents\" are currently just another accessory for you to increase Enemy Slayer / Absorb levels via shops or walks.\n\nIt's a very slow-burn game, and with its current content, it's about 4 times more expensive than it's worth. Only purchase if you're absolutely on board with a mindless game and extremely casual resource gathering for a few hours.\n\nThe current bosses are damn excellent though, and redesigning your entire island just to tear them down efficiently lends to the game's most interesting and satisfying moments. However, the satisfaction of a pretty island designed to annihilate a boss in a few short seconds or to conquer a whole biome is reserved for the few who take the time to get the crystals and understand how the stat mechanics work.\n\nI recommend it for the gameplay loop of optimizing an entire island for repeated boss encounters.

But then the thumbs down is meant to say whether or not others should buy and support it right now. \n\nBut then on the other hand. It's got a great concept, great look, great music, and infinite potential to be something truly special.\n\nSo do I give it a thumbs up because it might one day become something beautiful? Or a thumbs down because it's misguided, empty and unfinished?\n\nIn the end I decided to give it a thumbs up. Here's why. All the negatives and problems it has can all be explained away with it being in early access. Is it fun? not really. I was more lost and misguided than anything else which created frustration and boredom. But I give it a thumbs up because the game has some serious potential. You play as a witch who crash lands on an island. Now that you're stuck here, build up your house, support the community and farm. That's pretty much it. The thing that makes this game interesting is the magic mechanic. Not a whole lot of that at the beginning though, but it has some cool ideas that can be implemented later on down the road which looks and sounds interesting and overall just unique and different from normal farming sims. \n\nIt's just very empty right now, very unfinished. Don't expect a whole lot when you first jump in. It lacks in direction too, so don't try to do your own thing, just follow the quests for as long as you can and hope that eventually you'll feel comfortable enough to play on your own without direction. But overall it's a very relaxing, casual kinda game and if you've got some time to spare, or some money to spare and you wanna support a small gem that might one day become a diamond, then this is probably a good game to bet on. \n\nIf you'd like a more in depth look with some gameplay please check out the video on my youtube channel (link below).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZTIPbeIZKU\n\nOtherwise, thanks so much for reading and I hope I managed to help some of you out there to spend your money wisely.", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137559630", "app_id": "2166060", "review_text": "From playing the DEMOS and doing a deep dive into the puzzles this was amazing.", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137627195", "app_id": "1245560", "review_text": "Won a bear hat in a rope pulling competition. 10/10", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137561980", "app_id": "2359850", "review_text": "-This game is impossible to beat.

Combat is solid (Darth Vader is really living rent free inside Cal's head), exploration is satisfying, and weapon/skill progression/upgrades make you really feel like a Jedi. Gives Force Unleashed vibes (excluding all the dark side moves you could wield).

Not super challenging (even on hard mode), but the puzzles are a lot of fun to solve. It's a shame that this game has virtually no coverage at this moment in time. I completely forgot how this game meandered into my wish list, but I'm glad I did. \n\nPresentation wise, the pixel art graphics are very well done and the music is great (I would be appreciative if I had the ability to attain this soundtrack in some form or another). The plot is simple, but has served well to move the game forward. Questing - or completing goals and side tasks - is fun. The puzzles are intuitive and work well with the gun mechanics creating fluidity - The game definitely feels setup for speed runners. \n\nThe cotton gun is a pretty nifty mechanic as you will be finding modifications for the gun that allow you to get to different areas of the map - in the tradition of a metroidvania. The first power you get - which is just standard cotton - is the movement assist power - basically, you will shoot a cotton seed onto a viable surface (enemies included) - the cotton seed will expand which then you can jump onto which will bounce you upwards so you can reach hard to get places. Strategic placement of the cotton can maximize your efficiency moving around the map. The cotton can be chained pretty quickly too as you can shoot a new cotton seed right after one seed expands.\n\nThe bosses I've faced so far are pretty rudimentary, not too challenging, but fun to fight against. Though, I will say that I'm spoiled by the complex and challenging boss battles in your typical roguelike games like Skul the Hero Slayer, Hades and Dead Cells. \n\nBack tracking isn't too tedious as maps aren't massive (actually a prefect size for my taste), but sometimes, when I go back to a previous island to acquire an item to complete a quest on the current island I'm at, I just want the convenience to instantly go back to the area the item is need. Exploration is a lot of fun as you will be participating in a combination of platforming and puzzle solving to traverse the areas - as a bonus, the tile sets are pretty, making interesting landscapes - some that reek nostalgia from my childhood.\n\nOverall, not a lot of complaints for this one.

The Mushroom Woods really stood out as a beautiful area to explore, but overall the game looks so lovely. The NPCs were very distinct, with each of them featuring their own lovable personalities and ways of interacting with the player through delightfully charming dialogue. You really can\u2019t help but care for the townspeople of Clover, and I was more than delighted to fix up the town every step of the way. I don\u2019t feel like I can put into words how much I enjoyed the mechanics and platforming in this game. The controls are tight, the platforming segments are incredibly clever, and the quality of life details like the quest journal and the cosmetic options really just top off the gameplay experience. \n\nMy absolute favorite thing about indie games is the amount of love you can feel from the creators, and it is ten times as present in Re:Fresh.

The deckbuilding is intuitive and fun, slowly expanding the limits of what can go into a deck as you complete dungeons and grow your collection. \n\nExpanding the conceit out into a Mystery Dungeon-esque structure means cards can do all kinds of wacky stuff, like vaulting you across the room or pushing enemies into traps, some of which you can set up yourself. There's a really huge amount of stuff the cards allow you to pull off, which helps the game avoid feeling repetitive over multiple runs. \n\nThe dungeons themselves are lively and interactive, with different flavors of traps, props, and enemies that makes trucking through the desert dungeon require a wholly different approach than the ice dungeon. \n\nThe game's only real problem area is the puzzle rooms, which often feel impossible without particular card setups. Given that rewards for individual combats are thin already, being locked out of a puzzle room because there's no mobility in your deck, or because you don't have any answers to self-destructing enemies, feels weirdly restrictive for a game that otherwise rewards devising your own strategies. \n\nEven so, the best compliment I can give this game is that I have nearly 10 hours in it after something like three days and I have untreated ADHD.

That's ridiculous. The weapon level system is even more exaggerative and ridiculous as unlocking the camos for the gun You want to level is even more of an unnecessarily long process that You wouldn't even want to fully get the Gun maxed out. The challenges for camos are Plant the bomb 3000 times  ?? That's just an example and yes that's actually a challenge to unlock a whole SET of camos. What the actual f***k is going on ??  Besides that, there's multiple other unfair bugs and exploits going on And some even include being invincible. If you wanna mess around , rage and then quit then this game is for you.

There are plenty of dialogue choices with differing reactions and characters that you can build relationships with, although there are only a handful of serious choices that change the story\u2019s outcome.\n\n4.

Hopefully, this will change.\n\nSimply put, the naval combat in the game is extremely unrealistic. \n\nDuring the Civil War, ironclad vessels were the king of the era because very few naval guns could defeat their armor. Ironclad warships were oftentimes scoring a ten to one kill ratio, while battle between ironclads could drag on for hours while remaining inconclusive.\n\nIn the game, however, everything is based on RNG, no realistic consideration of gun penetration or armor whatsoever. A small paddle gunboat could one-shot your ironclad warship through some kind of \"catastrophic explosion\" just because RNG says so.\n\nDuring the Civil War, naval guns were also horrendously inaccurate at anything beyond point-blank range. It usually takes several broadsides to score a lucky hit on a faraway opponent, and even close range gunfire requires multiple ranging shots to be zeroed in.\n\nIn the game, however, gunfire at extreme range almost possesses 100% accuracy. This preposterous game feature ruined my immersion completely.\n\nMore so, the \"ramming\" attack that tends to sink wooden ships in a single strike does pathetic damage! Making the monstrous ram type ironclad almost ineffective.\n\nAdditionally, the game slowly descends into a non-functional state the further one plays into a campaign. On 1862 of the Confederate Campaign, loading a save is almost impossible. One would almost always have to quit out of the game in order to load an old save. What's more? I've been stuck on the screen where my blockade runner reaches Europe for many times now.\n\nAs an enthusiastic Civil War naval fan, I've read articles regarding almost every single Civil War maritime engagement and performed in-depth research regarding Civil War naval guns and ironclads. I chose to purchase this game because it is the only large scale Civil War naval game on Steam so far. Yet, the result is wholeheartedly disappointing.\n\nI could forgive the bugs. By all means, I've played so many buggy yet promising games in Early Access state before.\n\nYet, I cannot recommend Victory at Sea Ironclad because of the horrendously unrealistic, RNG based combat model.\n\nI will continue monitor the development of the game.

It's a love letter to these types of games, but also provides plenty enough to offer its own fun and unique experience.\n\nThe world you enter is full of lore and details, and it's very apparent that a lot of thought and effort went into the world you explore throughout. It offers a new perspective on the genre with the combination of resource collection and crafting with monster collection for your party, that works perfectly together.\n\nNot only is there a very large variety of monsters to find and collect in the game, but you can also create multiple elemental variants of each and every one, which gives some customisation and individualism in the party you create. Each monster on its own have been well designed and there's a lot of fun to be had in collecting the monsters and forming your party your own way.\n\nThe monster battling is where this game really shines. The battling system has a lot of depth and ingenuity behind it, giving a whole different experience from the Pokemon-esque battling. Other than trying to avoid the monsters, I found myself eagerly running into them to do more battling!\n\nOverall, this game has a lot of charm to it, and an extreme amount of love and effort has been shoved into this beautiful gem, so you should definitely give this game a go!", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137261586", "app_id": "2207490", "review_text": "Factory Town Idle is actually Factory Town but without the town building on map.

It takes a few tries before the logic clicks, but it's a very zen game once you get the hang of it.  \n\nI'm reviewing the 1.002 version that just launched.  This is an Unreal 4.27 recreation of the original game.  The music and kitschy videos from the original game have been lost to copyright issues, but the core game is here.  \n\nAs the game is right now, it's very rough around the edges.  \n\nThe good:  This plays near perfectly.  The original was a ps2 launch with severe interlacing issues, and sometimes the visuals would lag the whole system making the music skip.    Even emulated it's a struggle to find a balance between HD visuals and a lag free game.\n\nFantavision 202x at 165fps feels wonderful.  It's so fluid and it plays just right.  Everything snaps like it should.  The music and announcer are good enough.\n\nThe bad:  there are no config options at all and by default the game runs with an uncapped framerate with no vsync or resolution options.\n\n But, it's an Unreal game so, if you open up your %LOCALAPPDATA% browse out to \\fv\\Saved\\Config\\WindowsNoEditor and open up GameUserSettings.ini you can edit these lines:\n\n[/Script/Engine.GameUserSettings]\nbUseVSync=False\nFrameRateLimit=0.000000\nDesiredScreenWidth=1280\nDesiredScreenHeight=720\n\nI set the values to match my monitor, and then it with a proper vysnc.  The anti-aliasing is still a little ugly.\n\n\nI would recommend the game if you loved the original and have muscle memory for it.  \n\nIf you've never played the original, this version is still a little unpolished.  The original had a very cohesive kitschy design of retro-futurism, and this has that, but a bunch of stock photos over the parts that had to be removed for legal reasons.  There's no option to exit the game, it's just assumed you know Alt+F4 exits a program.  \n\nStill, I'm very happy that someone took the time to go back and make one of my favorite puzzlers playable on modern hardware.  \nI want to support this dev just for the time they took to bring back a hidden gem.

It is also possible to play using a mouse; use the left click to move, and the right click to interact. The only restrictions are that you cannot run and that no names are displayed when a mouse is however over an object. The least convenient device is a gamepad that lets you move around but prevents you from choosing topics during conversations. \n\nInteraction has some issues. Hotspots aren't highlighted, but if you walk through an area or a room, you can't really miss them. The problem is when more are stacked closely together. I once had two beds and a painting in the middle, and it was difficult to interact with the painting because there was only one place where the interaction appeared. The prompt changed to a bed when you took a single step to the left or right. I also managed to get stuck in one room because the door just stopped working. \n\nThe main gameplay involves moving about, conversing with everyone, and gathering clues. When you discover something intriguing, the clue is automatically recorded in your notebook under books, testimonies, or evidence. Finding the connections between the clues becomes your responsibility. You do this by selecting and adding them to the final report. If a connection exists, you will form a conclusion that you can either accept or find something else.\n\nAlthough there are only a few rooms you can enter and the town isn't particularly large, it works for a small game like this.

You must position the wizard on the appropriate areas around the playing field because you can only influence things in the four general directions and not diagonally. Additionally, if there are additional items in a row, you must move the first one out of the way in order to access the second one. \n\nThe limited number of moves at your disposal makes things more challenging. The requirement is so strict that there isn't even room for a single extra step. Fortunately, exceeding the number that alerts the guards doesn't mean defeat. You have an extremely helpful undo button at your disposal, which you will keep pushing until you find the solution.\n\nAnd you\u2019ll be doing that a lot because difficulty is definitely not casual. Before the game's halfway point, there are a few stages with about 20 steps; since there is no room for error, the challenges can be quite daunting. Relying on a single hint is useless. It's general advice like \"use only what you need\" or \"put things in the right place before making your move\".

These can be quite frustrating or time consuming now but with some additional world and npc interactions these could be made more interesting and less grindy. Currently the more interesting part of the game is solving murders. I don't know how procedural these scenarios are as of now but i've worked on three and they all worked out fine and reading the forums the experience can vary quite a lot depending on how you approach them. My first big murder was quite exciting, in my effort to do a good job i ended up finding a second victim and witness the attempted murder of the third in a cool example of emergent story.

The Lack of more content... now this isn't a major thing... its just i want more. and its coming, so don't let that get you down.\n3. The Walking/Movement... now it seems slow sure... but this was probably to slow the early game down... which is fine, but we need a faster movement later game.\n4. Doesn't seem to be any Stone Building/Brick/Clay building, could be a future update.\n5. Tools break fast... idk if its me... or i'm just using them to much.\n6. Figuring out Hides... is a nightmare... and needs improved... abit more... the Jackel hide as far as i can tell does nothing... the only way to get hides is from Boar.\n6. It rains to much... idk this just annoys me personally it constantly is rainning... but it is the tropics... i just wish it was less.\n7. Custom settings... for resource respawns... world day/night cycle... monster amount counts... stuff like this is missing and should be a feature later on... for Custom Difficulty.\n8. 2 Boats... at the time of writing this and playing it... I Was hoping more. then again still early access.\n9. Mapping is kindof weird... since i can't auto map while walking? like i've seen this area... just map it already? do it in a more smaller reveal area... if you want it that way... but when the map says NOTHING SEEn... i'm confused.... since i remember the area... explorers would just remember the stuff... not map everything... most of the time... ish.\n10. nothing really else... i can pull out of my head... game is fine, it just needs more updates.\n\nOverall worth the money, good devs, needs more content, fun to screw around with.", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137483374", "app_id": "2364810", "review_text": "Great", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137676187", "app_id": "1774580", "review_text": "amazing", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137409570", "app_id": "1607240", "review_text": "I absolutely loved this game, it felt like it had been tailor-made for me!

Not interested. It is alright for a couple of hours figuring out the mechanics and solving the first case but after that it just runs out of steam. Needs more murder cases to solve. More scripted story elements. The focus on a \"living breathing world\" just isn't working. You can't even kill people as that would break the games mechanics according to the dev. If I can't interact with the world, IT IS NOT A LIVING BREATHING WORLD. Add more murders to solve, add Sam etc. etc. the simulation has failed. And for gods sake add MOTIVE. It is incredibly difficult to add motive to RNG murders but if you write them then it can be done. Again, less RNG\n\nThe randomly generated sandbox while neat ends up just being a rather pointless copy and paste world that is nice to look at but once you actually look deep you realize all the locations are just copied and pasted but the information has been changed. One office building has a note that says the code is 1488 and then you go to another exactly identical office where the note is in the exact same position but this time the number is 2000. Instead of a Bob there is a Bill. You start to see the cracks in the matrix as you explore the world.\n\nAlso, the game does not run all that well. Sub 60 FPS, most of the time struggling to get 30 with an 12th gen i9. The vents are the worst offenders in them you get maybe 10-20fps. Not pleasant. AND THE VENTS ARE EVERYWHERE. Pretty sure they exist in a completely different universe and dimension. You have to travel 10 miles to get from 5th floor to 6th. I don't think that is how vents work. Also bugs, for example in the tutorial there is supposed to be a hidden alarm that goes off but sometimes it just doesnt and you have to load a save. A reward I was promised in mailbox 1401, was actually in mailbox 1301. The only reason I knew was because I had the indicator enabled(it is basically mandatory atm because of how buggy the game is) And in a sandbox game that is very open ended like this you just end up feeling confused wondering if this is supposed to happen and you just cant figure it out. Nope, the game is just buggy. \n\nBut it is in early access they will add more crimes to solve and change stuff up it is a neat game for sure. \nPersonally though, less focus the random world generation and add a proper story in this world and focus on that. Couple of murder cases to solve, maybe an abduction, seedy stuff throw a couple of written characters with their own quests and this becomes a brilliant game. Also improve performance. The core gameplay mechanics are quite good, but for example when you are beating a woman in the living room somehow she manages to run away and escape through the front door. After she took a massive beating?? Add knockback, there should be no way that a lady just runs away and ignores her injuries as I am blasting her face with my two fists of iron", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137424339", "app_id": "2166060", "review_text": "I love how dark it get's I hope to see more in the future.

The pin board system really allows you to make deductions and not hand feed it to you or allow just guessing the options until it works like so many other mystery games. This combined with the procedural simulation of a full city provide enough detail and red herrings that you can't just guess evidence one of four must connect with evidence four of four so this is the solution the game wants.\n\nFor example in one mission I found fingerprints at the murder scene on a open safe that weren't the deceased's. After interrogating a bunch of connections to the murder victim one person suggested an individual as the potential culprit. I tracked that person down to their apartment where they lived with someone else. No matter what I did their partner would answer the door not the person I was investigating. I was able to dust the door for fingerprints though and I got two sets, one matched the one from the crime scene. Even though my pin board let me take the fingerprints it didn't automatically assume or unlock those fingerprints as from the person I was investigating but I was able to deduce myself and place those fingerprints as evidence when turning in my case. Other games would require me to have done the right steps in order for the fingerprints to clearly show that they were the culprits before they could count as evidence in my final report. But this game allows enough flexibility and deduction on your own that I reasoned the two sets at the apartment were the culprit's and her partner's. Since one set of fingerprints were at the crime scene and everything else pointed to my suspect not her partner those must be the suspects fingerprints and I could submit them in my case report as such. Case closed. \n\nThe procedural generation and world simulation also allows for cases that aren't obvious and actually require deductive work. The game does not have a detective mode like from Arkham asylum that highlights everything and makes finding things trivial but it still strikes a balance of you actually have to look for evidence and how would I ever notice that. This makes investigating a crime scene actually fun and super rewarding when you notice something that cracks the case wide open. Also as demonstrated by the introductory mission, which is not entirely procedural in order to act like a tutorial, there's enough evidence that the case can be solved multiple ways. I went the route of interrogating a bunch of people and fingerprints while a YouTuber I watched went the way of who was the last person to call the victim and the trail that led to. You can see different people's let's plays of the mission for more examples. \n\nI highly recommend this! Even in this early state especially for fans of hard boiled noir crime dramas.

PLEASE PLAY THIS GAME IT IS AMAZING", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137718566", "app_id": "1669000", "review_text": "Never played Planetfall so i dont know what carried over but i have a decent amount of hours in AoW3 and its safe to say they improved on a LOT of aspects. Game systems feel so fresh and unique to other 4X games with its distinctive and appealing art and how its interacting with other systems like affinities, combat and event generator that you end up with so much choice that makes each playthrough different than the previous one.\n\nOf course there are areas of improvement that can and must be made by developers in the coming days. Some of these are pretty important ;) Hear me @devs\n\n[list]\n\n[*]Locations on the map. Now imagine yourself going for a nice burger, what would be important to you? Obviously the burger should feature a premium patty, big, juicy and well cooked patty that screams to be bitten... Well thats the units in game and oh boy they DELIVERED. There is an insane amount of different units to choose from that is customizable to further diffirentiate, for a newly released base game they really packed so much love into units. But... but... where are the locations on the map? xD I mean fighting is the core of the game but... there is little reason to \"clear\" the map.... Thats the hamburger bun failing to compliment its patty and other ingredients. You will see lots of units on the map that are just... standing there in mid to late game because they are protecting something you dont really need because you already have one of. Look at [url=https://age-of-wonders-3.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Structures] this [/url], these locations are in Aow3, now cut the list by half or even more ;) thats what you are getting (or how it felt like while i was playing my first campaigne.). Been a while since i booted up my AoW3 but i remember so many different points of interest on the map other than free cities and Players/AI. The last DLC in the expansion pack got this problem covered but its so far away as if thats not the priority.... Cmon man XD.\n\n[*]Animations. The majority of the money has gone to modelling so many different unique models, game systems, art and UI i believe :) Because the animations are leaves lot to be desired with. That is not to say spell animations are bad, no no no no no spell animations are distinct and pleasing enough... The animations im talking about are for the units. Like Tier1 peasant, essentially, feels like its striking way harder for what it really is (a peasant xd) compared to a Dragon. Dragon is just using its tail to \"touch\" the enemy model... Like bro? You are a dragon no? Be more intimidating and satisfying to use please? I mean... You look cool... I dont know, maybe roar before or after attacking or something? I dont hold this animation against them. Im very happy with the game i got on my hands but its just... you know... can be improved so to say.\n\n[*]Race and their identity. Stop giving boobs to every female of any race. Why do females of ratkin, tigran, mole people and toads have boobs? This UNDERMINES their biological identity. They are all become, essentially, humans with different flavor... And boobs are just one thing that comes to mind xd Using the same base mesh for every race, while makes it modular, was not the wisest choice when it came to making things unique. Still... at least I wont be playing the same humans every time i guess ;). Just something to keep in mind for DLC. And yeah maybe give each race its own unique unit and trait, not many, just 1 of each. Make 1 trait and 1 unit for each race alongside of mind/body traits (which are shared between races.), the unit doesnt even need to be adapted to the culture the player is choosing. You can literally give sphinx to Tigran for example no matter the culture, would add meaning to race choice. You can also make so that Tigran would get, say, +10 production or food while in the desert on top of the choice you get for desert adaptability in mind trait pool which are shared between races and they can opt in to start with it... This would put tigrans 1 step ahead in desert even if everyone chose desert adaptability for example, it would add more depth and uniqueness to each race.\n[/list]\n\nThese are the main things that comes to mind as cons and there are A LOT OF pros that i will leave others to preach about. Ultimately I, without a single doubt, recommend this game to EVERYONE that has some connection to strategy games. This game, until fanstractics comes or maybe even after that, is THE successor to HoMM3 while having its own identity and depth. Money is well spent. I will be buying the expansion pass soon as well, I am very happy with the product I got, packed with so much content from the get go its insane.", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137261843", "app_id": "1928420", "review_text": "pretty good tbh, the its a but hard to get used to tho.", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137615516", "app_id": "2009650", "review_text": "Ustwo have once again created a simple yet exciting puzzle game with a tactical twist that you won't want to put down. \nAbove all, I want to highlight the fantastic voice work that gives the characters so much life and charisma.\n\nThanks so much for your work.", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137669853", "app_id": "1294810", "review_text": "I love the idea of this game.\n\nI wanted to love this game.\n\n3 crashes to even get to the main menu is not helping me love this game.\n\nThe world feels empty.

It can hardly crawl. This is the essence of this review.\n\nNo, really. The features mentioned on the store page are extremely ambitious. Almost at a Dwarf Fortress level. The pricing too, is very ambitious. At a somewhat suspicious level, but I took the bait so I will avoid giving the impression I'm just a naive dude who got scammed.\n\nWith this out of the way, let's proceed to the actual review, as I choose to believe this is an actual game.\n\nThis will be somewhat fast, as the game is clearly at an early prototype stage. Feature wise, it seems the only things really possible are to learn spells, explore dungeons, and fight. Sure, there are some social interactions, in the form of complimenting people and wishing them a nice day, but hardly more. Supposedly one should be able to build a mage tower, but I can't find any ressource on how it is done.\n\nThe spell system might be interesting, but it's also very much in its infancy so I don't have much to say about it.\n\nThe dungeon exploration however deserves a comment. To address the biggest point : why the 3D ? The only thing it adds is more tedium for the player with the need to look left and right for loot in every single room. I honestly don't believe it is possible to salvage this to a point that justifies the additional development cost and assets.\nIf you don't have a precise idea that requires the 3D, I'd recommend scrapping it alltogether and replacing it with a text base interface. Even if you do have an idea, please just scrap it anyway until the idea is mature enough.\nLikewise, try to keep a proper order during development. Introducing levers before whatever they are supposed to activate is textbook putting the cart before the horses...\n\nThe combat system seems to be changing rapidly but I'll still make a few comments. First of all, the spells as presented really beg to be used in a top-down, tile based system, with both players and monsters able to move around. Instead, the player is static and the ennemies move on a 5x3 grid. I'm not saying it's unworkable, but it's still early enough in development to wonder if it's worth changing the system entirely. Or it would be if not for all the work already spent in making large sprites and animations (the combat mechanic should really have been prototyped and tested extensively before making any asset..).\nOn that note, this is a complete failure in readability. The largest sprites can complety obscure smaller ennemies behind them. The animation only serves to slow down an already slow gameplay. And the idea that sprites are modified by status effect (I'm thinking of freezing in particular) is just laughable. Do you really expect to be able to add 30 versions of the sprite for every new enemy ? Just use symbols to mark status effects, like all other modern games do.\n\nWould not recommend, not even at a lower pricing. This is not just early access. This is just a prototype. Considering what this prototype shows of the development practices behind this game, I truthfully do not have all that much hope in the developpers ability to deliver on their promises.", "label": 0}, {"review_id": "137439710", "app_id": "1623940", "review_text": "I've only played for 1 hour but I'm blown away by the fantastic style, setting and premise. \nWhen I recommend it to friends I describe it as similar to Limbo, but in a nightmarish nordic folklore setting. \n\nAlso bought the artbook, haven't gone through it all yet, but just the cover page just blew me away, so magnificant! \n(if you struggle to find the artbook, it exist as a pdf in the file location for the game)\n\nHighly recommend giving the game a try,", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137564694", "app_id": "2359850", "review_text": "I absolutely adore the music and the art style of this game.

Give players the ability to name their decks.\n2. Give players the ability to delete saved decks.\n3. There are quite a few bugs when playing in borderless window. IE: unable to select a dungeon. Unable to edit decks. Unable to buy things from merchants. When mousing over the options to do these things, it does not highlight. Your cursor has to be in a very specific spot for these options to highlight, but even then left clicking does nothing. Not until switching to fullscreen will it work.\n\nTo end the review, if you enjoy deck building games with meta progression and turn based combat/encounters, then this game is likely right up your alley, but I'd doing some research and waiting until the developers make some QOL changes.\n\n", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137408825", "app_id": "1774580", "review_text": "low fps on coruscant. like 40-45 at only 1080p.

It's a calm / relaxing game, with some horror elements sprinkled in.\n\nTook me about 4-5 hours to complete one play through, so it's on the shorter end of games.

The $50 price tag is a bit much even for a big fan of the original game though. I really enjoyed the original but bottomline, this in its core is still an older game and it shows.

As much as I enjoy LAL, the completion time for this game is much shorter than current Sqeenix or older Square games. Most folks will likely play this once and put it away forever, unless you really enjoy replaying LAL the full price is too much. $30 is much more feasible.

The new soundtrack is wonderful as well. The minute I hear that opening intro given that orchestral treatment it gave the goosebumps. Megalomania still blows my mind. I'm slightly sad they don't give you the option to swap to the original OST, but it's fine. Some really big name voice actors were hired to voice EVERYONE (except Cube), probably where most of the budget went.  The The ability to skip cut scenes is pretty sweet.

The spacecraft crashes onto a planet, so called \u201cearth\u201d. You will find yourself in the forest of a town where a villain, called \u201cDr.F.Rogman\u201d is rampaging and spreading chaos all around the town.\nHere you will meet all kind of people, kind or bad. And individuals that will try to hurt you. And of-course you will find companions as well. \nDepths of Insanity is a Demo game available on Steam. It\u2019s getting new updates frequently. Some things still are bugged, or not added yet. But the game is growing.\n\n[h1]The Game of The Play[/h1]\nWhen the spacecraft has crashed, you get to explore a small area where you will find a pond, a bucket, and a hammer on a toilet. When jumping into the pond before getting the bucket, it won\u2019t say which button to press to jump out of it. you can press \u201cC\u201d to jump out of the water. When achieving the bucket, it will tell you to press \u201cC\u201d to get out. You must use the bucket to extinguish the fire on your spacecraft and save your main computer from getting damaged.\nAfter saving it, a big explosion will appear and a path to another place will open. At that place you\u2019ll find the watch that will help you and being able to save the game.\n\nAt first when I played the game, I was to confused of where I was and what I had to do. The map didn\u2019t show clearly, and the only note I had was to explore the area around the crashed spacecraft and find things to repair it. And the only hint that I\u2019ve gotten is that we can make some workbench to fix the ship, but I have no clue how to make it.\nBut I went on some days later when a new update released. With a better map, more items, and more stuff. This time I had a way better view of what I was supposed to do and where I could go. The game is basically just walking around and exploring the map. When you meet G\u00f6ran, a shopkeeper who sells material and a few crafting stations, that you are able to purchase from him.\n\nWhen purchasing a crafting station the player will automatically teleport to the place that will be the temporally base. You need to manually go back to G\u00f6ran to buy the second craft station and or crafting material. Crafting materials is just to buy, it won\u2019t teleport the player back to the temporally base.\nAt the temporally base, you will find an axe to cut down trees and on other places around the map you will also find a sickle and a pickaxe. These tools are required for gathering materials or just removing objects that may be in your way.\n\nIn this game you will find the mayor of the town, A guy who gives away free spicy wieners, A guy who wants you to swim and some frog who\u2019s smart and has taken over the whole town.\n\nFor so much as I know, the building task isn\u2019t available yet. I am not quite sure if the game currently has the data and mechanics to reach the final stage and complete it. It might be but it\u2019s still missing a lot to run fluently. One big thing that would help very much is a task bar, or something that gives you missions so we know what to do. To give us instructions or hints of where to go.\n\n[u]SLAJM-WATCH-3000[/u]\nThe Slajm-Watch-3000 is what thing you need to use to either enter your inventory, stats, equipment, heals, and setting plus saving and leaving the game. The \u201cesc\u201d button won\u2019t do anything. Simply, the watch is the \u201cesc\u201d in a way and just everything else. The settings, the inventory, just all.\n\n[h1]Visual & Audio[/h1]\n[b]Visuals[/b]\nThe visuals have a cartoonish style on it and for the amount of ideas that has been put into the game, I quite like it. An easy work that adds the comedy and weird stuff that exists in it.\nLike when playing the game, one doesn\u2019t expect something better of graphics because the game was made that way, it was meant for the ground and items to look that way they do and simply not overcomplicating things.\nWhen trying to fight monsters or slashing cobweb, it can be a bit hard sometimes with the combination of 2D inside a 3D game. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t indicate that you are doing it or it  in general just needs to get more damaged. Unfortunately, there is no health bar for the enemies and no-damage counter when damaging them.\n\n[b]Audio[/b]\n[u]Back-ground music[/u]\nDepending on where you are on the map. The music will change. For example, if you find yourself in the forest near the skeleton castle, you will start to hear some creepy and loud music. Sometimes just an annoyingly sound that gets louder and louder.\nMost of the time as we hear the music, it isn\u2019t anything exciting or soothing. Its just some kind-of symphony. Like nothing that expresses out to oneself, or more like nothing that has a nice rhythm.\n\n[u]Voice-Acting[/u]\nThe voice of the main character could have been done a lot better. Partly with a better mic or some kind-of voice set-up area or making the voice a bit louder as it\u2019s a bit low.\nThe sounds that he makes when getting hurt or when needing to find a toilet after the \u201cchili hotdog challenge\u201d. It just sounds like he didn\u2019t put any effort into the voice acting. No emotions into the words and therefore no life into the role.\n\n[u]Sound effects[/u]\nSome sound effects that I remember clearly is when swinging the rusty sword. When eating chips to heal, it sounds like crushing chips and then nauseous noises from the main character. The click when drinking the soda. The \u201cbeautiful\u201d farts after the \u201cchili hotdog challenge\u201d and then the casual things: Cutting down trees, hitting rocks, and breaking down tall grass.\nThere isn\u2019t really anything much that has to be said about the audio.\n\n[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]\n[b]Pros[/b]\n\u2022\tGuinea pigs.\n\u2022\tG\u00f6ran and wiener man.\n\u2022\tThe updated map.\n\u2022\tChicken gun (Need more, please.)\n\u2022\tSo many ideas to the game.\n\u2022\tFitting name to the game (at times.)\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n\u2022\tSwimming test that cost 200. Need to swim through the rings, won\u2019t indicate that the player has gone or jumped through the ring.\n\u2022\tNo purpose or questline in game, just exploring to find stuff.\n\u2022\tAs far as I know, there is no way to make a crafting table or build the starter base.\n\u2022\tImpossible to beat the wiener challenge if I cannot build a toilet at the temporally base.\n\u2022\tSlashing monsters won\u2019t always indicate that the player has hit them. Some times they won\u2019t take damage.\n\u2022\tNo telling how to use the flashlight.\n\u2022\tThe moving and turning movement.\n\u2022\tThe map parts (Like when in one part, you just see the road cut off and then its just void and an arrow showing that you can go this or that way.)\n\n[h1]My final little thoughts[/h1]\nWhen I first tried out the game, I was only able to play for 83 minutes before almost going insane. So the name fits atleast. But after the update it worked a bit better playing it.\nThe controls for the game is quite unusual for games in general, with both the three main things that comes to mind, F4 to get full screen after getting into the game, X or Right click to open the watch where the save and exit tabs are, and then finally. That the player has to press ALT F4 to actually close down the game in the Menu.\nSo in my opinion, the game is okay but not good. It still need some fixes and maybe some upgrades. It\u2019s a 50-50 in a way. But in the end it\u2019s still not a recommended game, maybe for the future but for at the moment as it is. Its not.\n\nRating: 5/10\nSweet Sweet G\u00f6ran", "label": 0}, {"review_id": "137488067", "app_id": "1324130", "review_text": "Pokud mate r\u00e1di Rimworld, tak tohle budete milovat \u2665\ufe0f", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137409036", "app_id": "1869590", "review_text": "Disappointed game no fun at all. \nI dont understand where the fun at, the mechanics of this game is purely a joke.\nCant even type to your team to communicate, this is a team game right? how am i supposed to play with randos as a team if i am unable to talk? unless my team is full of bots \nSo far into game, seems all the score either from my team or enemy team are pure luck.

FIRST THOUGH I need to say that the keybindings are absolutely terrible if you're playing with a keyboard, and if you try to change them, it breaks the Combo Key, making it impossible to progress in the game. However, if you're playing with a controller, everything is great!\n\nThis game is unlike most farming games in that it is turn-based; you set up your farm exactly how you want it each day at your own pace, then you press a button to advance to the next day. Between days, changes will happen (plants will grow, animals will eat, etc.) and then you set everything up how you want it again (feeding animals, planting and harvesting, etc.) and then you repeat this as the days go by.\n\nAlso unlike many other games, there is no money in this game. Items are acquired through a trading system. For example, a female marmot can be traded for a young rabbit, or a marmot meat can be traded for cabbage or berry seeds. You'll have to strategically trade and raise your way to more variety of animals and crops. At first you will only have marmots and grass, but you can trade a female marmot for a rabbit, then trade marmot meat for cabbages to feed the rabbits, then clip their wool and use the wool to trade for chickens and wheat, etc. etc.\n\nIn addition to farming, there is also a hunting system in which you raise dogs and a few other animals to fight wild animals for prizes and to keep them from attacking your land. The hunting system plays out like a turn-based RPG where you select various actions for your animal like attack and retrieve each turn.\n\nAnimals also can come in various colors depending on how you care for the mother during pregnancy. For example, I got a cream colored marmot baby from my normal brown marmot. And they can come in white, black, etc. and there is a diary where you can keep track of all the different colors you've acquired and go for 100%.\n\nThe game has some difficulty in it in the resource management aspect. For example, if you trade away all your grass for pasture seeds, then breed many rabbits, you may find you have no grasses to feed your rabbits, and they will die. This gets more complex as the game goes on and you need a wide variety of feeds and crops and meats to take care of all the animals. You have to plan ahead and make sure you have all the resources you need. You can't simply buy new feeds when you need them, you will have to make sure you have planted enough pasture, cabbage, wheat, etc. for your animals as time goes on. This is especially important for over the winter when you can't easily grow new foods.\n\nAs for bad things: The controls can be a bit tricky and obnoxious at times. Especially with things like trying to lay fences in a row, it gets very difficult because of the finnicky mechanics. You will spend a lot of time picking things up and putting things down again trying to get them where you want them. For the most part though you will just be tossing things everywhere, so don't expect to have a very pretty farm until much later in the game. It is very messy farming at first. I've also noticed sometimes the controls are a little unresponsive in a few moments in this version, but it has not spoiled the game for me so far, and hasn't been a big deal overall.\n\nAlso if you've played the game before, this version has a little more content than previous versions, has all the added content from PSP version, and now has 7 active inventory sockets.", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137676209", "app_id": "1607240", "review_text": "This was the cutest game ever!

Before it felt like a hassle, now the gameplay feels fun. If you don't have a controller, tough luck).**\n\nKeyboard: The game is fun but the controls are actually complete *ss. There's an \"aiming\" mechanic on keyboard, but you have to do a specific set of button presses to get it to aim in the right direction, you move slow as hell while \"aiming\", and you can't change the direction of the aiming mode unless you exit it. \n\nProgression: Make gold easier to obtain early on and make the souls actually spawn from enemies more than 1/5 kills (like seriously, one run I had to kill 10 mobs just to obtain my FIRST exp spawn). There's simply no point in having the most boring gameplay at the start.\n\nComparison: Unlike in Vampire Survivor where the gameplay is rewarding and relatively easy for the beginning, the gameplay here feels both clean and clunky at the same time. This isn't a skill issue either, I have played several of these types of games, as well as other bullet hell types, and the difficulty both feels refreshing for the genre while at the same time unnecessarily tedious. **(Edit: As I stated above, with the controller instead of keyboard, the gameplay is simply challenging in a fun way)**\n\nFor now its way too time heavy based for little gold reward, which means you must rely on the achievements to make any real progress at the start. The first class basically has 4-5 of its weapons based on the direction you move, making it feel agonizing to play.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n**(Edit: For Keyboard) Make the \"aiming\" mode allow you to move in whatever direction you want while AIM in whatever direction you want at the same time. The slow movement wouldn't matter if that were the case as it would offset the \"OPness\" of being able to freely aim without running directly into an enemy.**\n\nI would also make more weapons auto aim, at least at the start. From what I can see only the Lightning bolt and bone has the ability to auto aim atm, and it would be pretty cool if the second sword weapon had such a function as well (or at least \"attack the nearest enemy\"). Can even take the auto aim off the bone to compensate.\n\nGame Control Rating (Keyboard): 2/10\nGame Control Rating (Controller): 7/10\n\nGameplay Rating (Keyboard): 6.5/10\nGameplay Rating (Controller): 8/10\n\nSound Design: 7/10\nArt Design: 9/10\n\nP.S: For people with easily disturbed feelings, this doesn't mean I hate the game, in fact, I think the game has alot of potential.

I'm going to word my review as a direct parallel to the person with the highest liked negative review, because it's blatantly false in a number of different ways.\n\nFor context, I really enjoy tower defence games, and have played most of them. I still hold the highest rated negative review on Rogue Tower, and I have gone back to Rogue Tower and been disappointed, as I know many of you reading this have.\n\nI do think this game has some flaws - Hope IS a pain to generate at the stage of the game I'm at. Would have been nice to get something for completing the trophy challenge on a stage too, which I hope the devs address.\n\nBut that same thing gives the game some staying power. There is a lot to unlock here, and many different stages and stage types with a number of interesting permutations. \n\nIn short, I really enjoy the game as it currently stands, and I'll continue playing it. I'm 2.2 hours at the time of writing this, have completed three stages, and challenge completed two. My mind may change as I continue, but I can't hold off on this with some dude spending 20 minutes and calling the game an utter failure.\n\nFrom here on I will be counterpointing that review with my own.\n\n1. Grind. Everything does cost more faith than the demo, however it is easier now to earn faith with the replay mechanic. x4 speed means a session is over in about 12-15 minutes. The gold you get goes down faster than the demo and you reach 0 gold gained a few waves sooner. There are also unlocks that counterbalance this if you need it - I did not need it, but the unlock is quite powerful.\n\n2. Progression. Faith costs are higher, but you can earn faith faster than in the demo if you learn the mechanics of the game. It does feel like some tower unlocks are more expensive, but since there is like almost 30+ maps to the game, it's probably a good thing they spread it out like this. The overall difficulty feels a little bit harder, but honestly - I smashed my first three runs without leaking a single unit. I only played the demo once, so it's not like I'm some ultra skilled god at the game.\n\n3. Difficulty. It's a little bit harder. I find boss waves a bit of a joke honestly because I can slap down the accumulator immediately - it's only now a few maps in that the final boss tends to give me a bit of pain (especially if it's the shield boosting one). Once again, faith isn't the limiting factor of unlocks, hope is (showing the negative review didn't play the game fully).\n\n4. Curses. The negative review says he experienced BS and ragequit (on the first, or maybe second level, given his playtime) due to the curse mechanic. I agree that the curse mechanic is poorly explained - terribly so. Basically you will get corruption when one of the corrupt enemies goes in range of some of your towers. This leads to interesting strategic decisions on tower positioning, but one of your earliest unlocks will mostly negate corruption in the early maps anyway.\n\nI do agree that explaining corruption and how it works needs to be in the game, obviously, as a tutorial step. It was brutal the first time I was blindsided by the corruption mechanic. I have mixed feelings about the faith nuking mechanic behind advanced curses, but it does force the player to learn how corruption works, and manage it effectively.\n\nHOWEVER - I can't fathom how someone managed to play the demo as extensively as the negative review suggests, and struggle with the first two levels of the game to such an extreme that he had massive curse overflow. If you were brand new to the game, I can imagine it (which is why I suggest a tutorial for that NEEDS to be baked in on the second level) but not for anyone even remotely seasoned.\n\nI feel the game is quite fair, it's got a nice layer of strategy with tower placement mattering more than a traditional TD game, but less than a mazing style TD game. The powers are interesting, and I like it when I unlock something new and have a cool mechanic to play with.\n\nI do wish the game would telegraph some things better, like when I unlocked god powers, I had no idea how to activate them for a while (shift click over your temple). But the actual GAME part is solid as heck. Certainly a tonne more content here and interesting mechanics than Rogue Tower, and clearly made by a dev who actually understands game design.", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137568428", "app_id": "1321440", "review_text": "10/10", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137821697", "app_id": "2194710", "review_text": "crash test v1.", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137422739", "app_id": "1324130", "review_text": "What an amazing game.

Loved it!", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137420976", "app_id": "1324130", "review_text": "Hands down the worst task scheduling I've ever seen in a game. \n\nYou give the order to mine some stones or ore somewhere. One of your guys will walk there, which takes him a thrdr of a day to get there, then mine ONE rock and then walk that huge distance back to base to - and I kid you not - refill some wall torch. And do you know what makes this even better? He doesn't even carry the stone he just mined back to base. \n\nYou have 5 furnaces right next to each other to produce bricks for a house that you're building. All 5 furnaces are done burning a load of bricks and need to be emptied. One of your guys goes to a furnace picks up ONE load of bricks out of that furnace and carries it to the construction site. Let me get this straight: They can carry 20 times that amount of bricks. If he would go to the storage and pick up bricks there, he could pick up 20 times the amount he's carrying from that one furnace. Why doesn't he pick up the bricks from the other furnaces RIGHT beside him? Why doesn't he refill and start them before carrying the bricks off?\n\nThe NPCs are so SUPER frustratingly bad programmed it will make you pull your hair out. They have absolutely no ability to plan ahead, e.g. \"Will I be hungry when I arrive at the location where I have to work so that I will immediately turn around when I get there to go back to base and eat something? Should I maybe eat something now?\". They are in complete ignorance of their surroundings when working on a task, e.g. the example above with emptying just one furnace although several others are next to it that could be emptied too.\n\nThe option to give direct orders to one of your NPCs doesn't help much either. From what I have observed, after doing a couple or even just a single task of the things that you've given a direct order about (e.g. pick berries of 10 bushes), the NPC has a chance to just ignore your order and keep on doing what he wants to. To use the example of the 10 berry bushes, an NPC may pick the berries off of 3 bushes or so and then leave. Bizzarly that \"check to see if the NPC wants to do something else\" only happens after finishing a progress bar, but not while that NPC is working on a progress bar. So an NPC that has simply chosen on own to research a certain project, which takes a long time to finish the progress bar, may stay at the research table until he's \"ravenously hungry\" or sleepy to the point of almost fainting, which can easily be 12 ingame hours, but when you give him a direct order to, let's say build that last 10 walls of your vitally important defensive structure, he may just wander off (literally to take a walk or play an instrument for recreation), after finishing 3 walls in maybe 20 ingame minutes. THE DESIRE TO PLAY THE DIDGERIDOO IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE EXCUSE TO DISOBEY ORDERS!\n\nThis game is SO super grindy, but not because you have to do a lot of action A to be able to afford object B, but because there's just SO MUCH useless overhead due to the sheer incompetence of your NPCs task scheduling.  \n\nOther things that are badly implemented are the moral system and the research tree. The issue of the research tree is pretty simple: You'll be done with all research after about 1/4 of the time you need for a playthrough. Very rarely you'll stumble on a special research project when doing exploration, but that is really rare. In 18 hours of playtime that happened 3 times to me and it took about 15 minutes in total to research these new research projects. \n\nThe moral system is another thing that looks good on paper but is badly implemented. In short: Your people will sometimes just lose it and have a mental breakdown during which they are uncontrolable no matter what you do. Your NPCs can have a nice bed in an air conditioned room, they can have a variety of tasty food, several opportunities (and items) to have leisure time (dart games, music instruments, sports equipment)...but then you read something like \"Had a an argument with Nancy\" in the details of their moral status page which impacts their moral by a value of -18 (on a scale of 0 to 100). Several of such trivialities can add up and when it pushes their moral score to a value below 20, they have a breakdown. GODDAMIT TRACY, JUST BECAUSE NANCY WAS MEAN TO YOU AND THE FACT THAT YOU HAD SOUP FOR DINNER INSTEAD OF RATATOUILLE DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO GO BERSERK AND SMASH OUR ONLY DIESEL GENERATOR!\n\nTo summarize my review: This game isn't hard, it's just frustrating. The sheer incompetence of your NPC in executing their tasks produces so much overhead that the game progresses painfully slow. It's not relaxing either because every few minutes you'll be attacked by animals that just spawn at certain times and you'll have to manually order your NPC to go to combat stations. If one of your NPCs should happen to be at the place where those attacking animals spawn, well, tough luck, time to reload an autosave.\n\nNice concept, good intentions, but everything is ruined by the bad implementation.", "label": 0}, {"review_id": "137441754", "app_id": "1321440", "review_text": "I had fun with this game and I will continue to have fun.

Les combats sont extr\u00eamement grisants, entre les 5 styles de combat possibles, le syst\u00e8me de parade et l'inutilit\u00e9 de l'esquive sauf dans certains cas. Les pouvoirs de la force sont au nombre de 3 mais peuvent \u00eatre pratiques pour se sortir d'une impasse en combat. \n\nLe level design : Actuellement je trouve que nous avons des environnements tr\u00e8s star wars  (une plan\u00e8te d\u00e9sertique, une station spatiale, coruscant etc) mais qui vont dans le bon sens. La vie animale est pr\u00e9sente, la verticalit\u00e9 est aussi utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 bon escient et permet d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but du jeu de profiter de quelques tricks.\n\nL'histoire : Alors sans spoiler, c'est une bonne suite, une histoire typiquement star wars mais surtout qui fait le lien avec la Haute R\u00e9publique des romans et Rogue One.  \n\nLes graphismes et la direction artistique : Autant le premier ne m'avait pas \u00e9bahi pour ses d\u00e9cors. Mais alors l\u00e0, c'est tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rent. Je suis un gros fan du travail r\u00e9alis\u00e9 sur les environnements, Koboh par exemple offre quelques bi\u00f4mes sympa (La for\u00eat, la plaine, la montagne, le marais...). A cot\u00e9 de \u00e7a, les personnages sont excellents, le Gen'daii me rappelle beaucoup The Old republic (le mmo), Garan pue la classe, les anachor\u00e8tes, les chasseurs de prime, bref c'est du tout bon.\n\nPour finir, je conseil vivement ce jeu pour tout fan de jeu d'aventure, de star wars et de gens avident de trancher des jambes au sabre laser.

I'll be honest: you're better off getting Dead Island 2 for less than this on another platform or wait for when it launches on Steam.\n\nSorry Arkane devs, I know you've been pressured by your publishers to release this as-is. Unfortunately, the game that's out now is nowhere near worth the price (not even 50% off) due it simply being low quality in graphical fidelity and gameplay.

There are camera settings in the menu that either make your camera rigid to the back of your character, or swing wildly around as you move, but with precise platforming on small platforms, I find myself frustrated very quickly. It's impossible to look around for the next place I need to go without falling off the platform I'm standing on, or land precisely when using my glider.

Survivor gameplay seems to relate more to what gear you pick up, rather than your perks or personal ability, but those do count for something as well. Each character has a unique ability, along with a perk tree and they each feel unique and somewhat interesting.\n\nDemon gameplay is severely weaker. Early game you build your power by setting traps and scaring the survivors. Eventually you gain the ability to summon 2 types of minions + your self (as a boss unit). The summons are limited to 2 (which means you can drop 2 of each). You can make them stronger via your ability tree, but depending on what gear level the survivors have reached, your units are very likely going to be swatted out of the way with ease. Perk play a HUGE part in the Demon gameplay, as they are required to make your units better or faster.\n\nConclusion: If you like playing a Survivor and smashing through the \"killer\" to save the day, without much challenge.

There is a little \"debug\" mode you can get in the town below the couch if you have 250 Ringalings, it's cool for a minute so you can explore places especially areas that are out of bounds normally. So again the Ringalings do have a purpose. \n\nAny game where I can be something like an ant and explore a room like the one in the game is always pretty fun in regards to detail, there are things like bouncy balls and jacks for you to throw down and will need to use against some building blocks.

Of course you won't find anything new or revolutionary in this game, but I STRONGLY recommend the purchase if you simply want to see with your own eyes what made the classic videogames of our childhood so spectacular and unforgettable.\nCheers guys!", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137422865", "app_id": "986130", "review_text": "Thrill Gill: Volume 1", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137466716", "app_id": "1928420", "review_text": "best game for 2023", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137409956", "app_id": "1623940", "review_text": "WONDERFUL", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137268034", "app_id": "506480", "review_text": "It's interesting", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137553668", "app_id": "2311140", "review_text": "5/10 An unusual adventure/puzzle where you control a butterfly and start scripted events.\n\nGood:\n- the basic idea of \"butterfly\" effect is interesting\n- the 7 levels actually look nice, even though most objects have simple geometry\n- there is some humor in the texts and the events\n- I liked some black humor (e.g. when a guy dies, falls into water - and yet still after that gets eaten)\n\nSo-so:\n- cause and effect are hard to figure out. More like, you press F all the time to see what objects can be interacted with and the fly to them and interact to see what will happen. Typically only after you see the scripted sequence you understand what object that was, what you interacted with. So there isn't any real agency, more like just watching\n- no music \n\nBad:\n- butterfly controls are just horrible. It's hard to see where exactly in 3D it is located. In some of the scenes (e.g. the railway station) there is a shade but in others none. Moving a butterfly to a required spot is a challenge by itself. And a wrong kind of challenge which makes you lose interest in the game\n- some object seem to be impossible to interact with even though the F key shows particles spray. It's confusing and messy\n\nOverall, an interesting idea but not so well implemented. Worth a look though not sure you'll see more that 1-2 stories completed. I only managed one.

Maybe not Detective based, but deduction and putting pieces together.  I love the dynamics of the game.  Randomized events, citizens with schedules. The game feels alive, though with a dark bleak setting.  I know this is early access, but at this time, playing the game and solving missions is satisfying.  There are a few hiccups here and there, but overall, I think an excellent experience.\nThe Good:\nThe 'training' mission gets you to a good start at understanding the mechanics of the game.  It gives you a taste of almost everything to be able to play the game properly.  The randomization of the city is also nice,  Though, early navigation may drive you to keeping the same city in multiple plays.  \nI also enjoy the variety of how you can approach getting your clues.  From bribery, to lock picking, to disabling security, to hacking, to straight up assault.  The variety of the lay of the land is quite refreshing.\nThe Bad:\nThese I hope will be cleaned up as they move to release, but still are things to take note of.  First, very minor, as targeting a door will put a text prompt on the screen of the dwelling info, but some door numbering is backwards.  Not all, but some, which kind of through me off a bit.  Also the visualization of body types is hard to judge, forcing you to have to scan everyone if you are looking for someone with, say, a Large Build.  Thin seems to be easy enough, but the others seem to be too close to tell.  Other than those 2 gripes of the graphics, I am happy in that department.\nThe collection of data seems to be a hit and miss for me.  Some things that should connect together don't.  Forces me to leave some clutter on my connections screen.  Also, in relating to data, there should be a check box for relevant and and irrelevant data.  When I have to skim through stuff I scanned, a football is not something I need to re-focus on, in most cases.  As to stored data, keys are a bit of a pain as well.  When I get a key, it tells me what it is for, but I cannot find that info again.  Maybe just me?  But it would be nice to have a key ring that you can go through to see all the keys you have.\nNot sure if there is an upgrade for your inventory (this game does allow you to find character upgrades as you play), but I find that a bit slim, especially in the beginning when you need to \"scavenge\" and pawn stuff for some cash.  \nThese are all minor, but noticeable to me.\n\nTrust me that the good by far outweighs the bad.  I have been waiting for a game like this since the days of Covert Action and MidWinter, where you were free to track down leads as you saw fit in the manner you wanted to pursue.  Hopefully this will spark more variety of games like this, where they are great sandbox games to delve into those words again.\n\nGreat job on this.", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137489479", "app_id": "1774580", "review_text": "Fantasic game so far.

It's very colorful and you find weapons of different types as you explore. You start with just a sword, but also find great swords, scythes, whips, and at least one other type of sword. There's a ton of space and the level design isn't extremely memorable, but it's memorable enough for you to recognize certain spots. The map also lets you place up to 200 reminders with various icons, which is nice.\n\nCombat feels pretty good to me, as it's similar to a lot of classic games in the subgenre. You can have two weapons equipped at once and most weapon hits will keep the majority of enemies from attacking. You can dash forward or backward, which I think works quite well, but you don't get I-frames, so don't be expect to constantly dash through enemy attacks. A lot of enemy projectile attacks can be knocked back to enemies and you can equip a tome to use elemental magic spells. Weapons can be improved with a consumable you'll find on occasion, but you absolutely won't want to use these all the time, as you consistently find better weapons. \n\nAfterimage is an action-RPG, of course, and the main character, Renee, levels up upon accruing sufficient experience, which grants you talent points that can be spent on a skill tree. You'll also find talent points whilst exploring. These will give your stats a buff, as well as teach you new abilities for specific weapons. I'm fairly satisfied with all of this. The exploration is similar, as I really feel like the game does a fantastic job of incentivizing you to look in every nook and cranny, as there's a lot of great stuff to find. You'll naturally also be able to backtrack and find new stuff with your movement abilities.\n\nNow for the stuff I'm not crazy about. When you die, you lose all of the experience you have on you since the last time you level up. This obviously isn't a giant deal and you'll get it all back by touching it at the spot you perished. Afterimage also makes use of a bonfire equivalent, so you'll respawn at these, as well as heal. Resting will bring back any defeated enemies and refill your healing charges too. The game isn't all that difficult, though, and there's no stamina management or anything of that sort, although your MP will recover over time. The bonfire equivalents are quite far from one another, though. The map also doesn't fill in automatically, and it only fills in the places you've been upon using a bonfire equivalent, which I don't mind so much.\n\nAs for another thing I don't care for, you can only fast travel by using a consumable (at least, so far). This obviously puts a major damper on going back and exploring, but these consumable might be easy to come by later. Early on, I only found a single one of these, so don't expect to find them all the time in your first few hours. Overall, I'm enjoying the game and it offers most of what I like to see in a Metroidvania.

This time though, the game takes a step in the 3rd dimension again, making it a full fledged 3D platformer.\n\nAll of the above mentioned games play a role in being sources of inspiration for Bramble, some more directly than others. Often times you'll think \"Hey, I've seen this scene in <insert game from above list>\". But the game does also enough of its own things to stand out from the others:\n- the well executed cinematic tracking shots as you walk through the insanely beautifully designed nature of sweden\n- a greatly told story referencing nordic myths and fairy tales narrated through voice acting\n- some of the most detailled gorey nightmare scenes we've yet seen\n\nAll of this is embedded in very lighthearted puzzle platforming, very easy and thus not distracting so your eyes can enjoy the many details of this world. The 3D gameplay doesn't involve many unfair jumps, and the checkpoints are very briefly seperated. There are also surprisingly many boss fight, but they are also not very difficult, so the frustration factor is very low. Also the boss phases do have checkpoints.\n\nThus this also comes with a warning: If you seek a challenge in games and get bored easiely with shallow gameplay, Bramble might underwhelm you. For the rest of us, the path of cinematic platformers could not have a better entry today. Bramble foreshadows what's possible with games becoming a playable piece of artwork.\n\nI'll gladly return to the world of Bramble often, like the other games in my list above.

It lets you play differently based on the state of the map, and changes up the angles you try to hit besides just shooting straight into the goal.\n\nOverall, really fun game and excited to see what the devs have in store!", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137467405", "app_id": "1245560", "review_text": "Oh absolutely", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137675432", "app_id": "2363700", "review_text": "Brilliant little game!

Really annoying interface design choices that make no sense, such as when you lay siege to a city, it puts a giant \"Diplomacy\" button at the top, even though laying siege has no diplomacy impact at all whatsoever, nor does it provide any sort of diplomacy options. BUT god forbid you accidently click it, because it cancels all of your siege projects, and if you want to get them back then you'll have to cancel your siege and then start it back over from scratch.  Probably the worst UX though is in the race and map creation itself though, the touted features that are the only redeeming thing about this game.  The ONLY way to edit a race, hero, or map is to start a new game and then do your edits there.  However, it won't save those changes.

Quest lists are neatly arranged with quest givers easily found on the map.\n\nAlthough, while the first few days are slow, eventually you'll have so much to do that the in game day is too short (around 20 minutes). Hopefully the devs will allow players to tweak the day length in a future update as they promised in a Steam thread discussion.\n\nWhen it comes to exploration, the caves have puzzle based obstacles that'll allow you to open up new rooms and acquire uncommon materials. The huge areas outside of town really lends itself to exploration as you discover wild varieties of plants and animals which are tracked on your map once discovered.\n\nWhen it comes to befriending the townsfolk and romanceables, you can only give them gifts once a day twice a week. All the gifts you've given will have a like and disliked list within their profile along with their family relationships.\n\nTaming animals is easy and I've heard that there is a breeding system. Getting a rideable animal helps you in travelling the huge maps.\n\nI haven't tried multiplayer and I didn't bought this game for this feature but according to reviews in Youtube, you have to make a new character when joining someone else's world which means starting from 0 when it comes to tools. It'll be quite inconvenient for those who want a casual drop in and play session so if you want to play with a friend, play together from day 1. I also hope that the devs will allow players to use their existing characters in multiplayer.\n\nThat's all for now.

And does *not* disappoint. Casette Beasts tries new things, and experiments with the Monster Taming genre. And it did really well in my opinion.\n\nThe characters are lovely, the music is amazing (I personally adore vocals in Boss Music, it reminds me of the Persona series), and the Monster designs (subjective) were really awesome. And with the unique fusion mechanic, there are over 14,000 Combinations, making for really fun team building.\n\nThe world was fun to explore, and the quests were fun to complete. And the battle system, was just OK in my opinion.\n\nI enjoy that they tried something new, but I personally didn't find learning how all the types interact - intuitive? This isn't a deal-breaker for me, but if the battle system is for you, I would look into it more before purchasing.\n\nI think with some quality of life improvements the battle system could be made better. There currently isn't any \"Super Effective\" or \"Not Very Effective\" esq flavor text when you use an advantageous move. So I found it rather difficult to know when I was using a move if it would be my best option at the time.\n\nOn top of that as other reviewers have pointed out, currently when you switch companions, they take the Monster they were currently equipped with, with them. And you can't access it without swapping back to them, then accessing the storage, putting it away, then switching back, and then going back to the storage to retrieve it. This was rather inconvenient to deal with.\n\nThese things alone aren't deal-breakers for me and I really enjoyed my time with the game.

Something to think about as someone with Red-Green color blindness it was very easy to miss the torch spots.

No one wants to wade through boring gameplay for a good story. I do wish night got a little darker as I found no need for the flashlight at default gamma. I think a cool feature for a game with large ships and a lot of time to break them down would be a \"TimeLapse\" feature that would take a picture in an in-game camera of the progress and you could play it back when you complete the ship. \"Dock Lights\" might also give a great atmosphere at night if you can upgrade your salvage area.

After starting to play a few minutes of Bramble: The Mountain King, I told myself I'd make a review for this game after my playthrough - yet it became immediately necessary during the part where I heard one of the songs of the game, \"Blomstertid\", man - I was literally taken aback by emotion hearing it, simply the most beautiful music I've ever heard in a video game, even if short - and came to a realization, although I have yet to finish the game: in spite of its' tiny flaws (that don't prevent from enjoying it), this game has something really special and wonderful to show and give.\n\nWhat caught first my attention were the graphics though: an incredible care and sense of detail were brought to them, the beauty is visually omnipresent too, although counterbalanced by some necessary darkness and gloom, the game having some horror elements - by the way, it seems clearly inspired by old fables, a bit like Hansel and Gretel, but with . . . a gory side to it by what I saw, so I couldn't say Bramble would be for kids: there are explicit depictions blood and cadaver meat included here : )\nOtherwise, as for the \"bright side\" of the game's art, when it's cheerful and joyous, it really is: bright colors, vivacious elements of nature, and strange beings / animals taken straight out of a tale give all of it an enchanting vibe, the graphics and music finding a cohesion and coherence that is near perfect. \nMy only small gripes with the graphics were that the textures / renders looked a bit \"plastic\" and old sometimes in my opinion, nothing shocking nor preventing from enjoying the game's beauty, but I think the devs could have done an even better job with the renders, even if easy to say. Otherwise, it's just an incredible work of art, in which you can feel all the love and attention poured into it, so can't criticize that much.\n\nThe gameplay is very simple, nothing demanding nor difficult to get - I'll be honest, I have yet to go on with the game, so I don't know if it gets much harder after, but so far it's really not challenging; and even with this rather \"easy\" aspect, I got hooked from the start of Bramble and couldn't let go of my controller until I decided to make a review. So as for the gameplay, no noticeable thing to say, aside that the difficulty makes it welcome to any player, and it renews itself enough to keep the player captivated from the start and after. The only flaw I encountered with it was that sometimes the movements feel a little slow and stiff, but absolutely nothing gamebreaking.\n\nWell I wish there were more games like this on Steam! I first started it by default, without knowing that much what I was getting into, and was more than \"not disappointed\", I was surprised and amazed - so frankly, I'd recommend Bramble: The Mountain King to any player (over 10 yo maybe lol) who wants to play something different and refreshing - because all inspired from some old fables it is, it simply reactualizes all of that kind of folklore into an indie game offering a little journey between light and darkness, with a  personality of its' own, and a remarkable one at that - fully recommended.", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137486115", "app_id": "1432380", "review_text": "Fast and ridiculously fun combat system.

Cannot recommend this game enough.\n\nNot only does it tackle Nordic folk tales in a visually striking way, it also seamlessly weaves the cute and wholesome with the morbid and macabre. While sadly there is no codex to compile all of the folklore you see, nearly every chapter revolves around a central folk tale which gets exposition via wonderful art and narration.\n\nWhile you see most mechanics in first third or so, they all receive their own chapter-specific mixup in unexpected ways. In that sense, the game is very accessible (although the final encounter might give you some trouble if you're a very casual player) and worth it for the Nordic flavour alone.\n\nIn a way, the game doesn't necessarily innovate any one genre; it doesn't have a hidden subtext about depression nor does it have any mind-blowing twists. But it's so masterfully crafted, complete with an amazing soundtrack and at least one encounter that's hard to gush about without spoiling it, that I really think it's worth the admittedly fairly high price point for the 5 hours it's going to take for you to clear it.\n\nThis is one of those cases where a game is excellent because it does one thing and excels at it.", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137465104", "app_id": "1321440", "review_text": "Holy banger OST", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137471201", "app_id": "2295920", "review_text": "Game is fun, very easy and I think it's perfect for just turning off my brain and listening to music or watching Youtube videos while playing.\n\nUnfortunately, it looks like autosaves currently suck as I was on the second mission picking up a couple items off the floor when I suddenly got a random UE4 crash and when I launched the game again, I was back right before finishing the first mission, meaning I lost about 65 minutes of progress.\n\nEdit: I turned my HUD off and back on and suddenly some bars appeared on my screen, one with a hammer and one with a truck. They wouldn't disappear off my screen so I saved the game, went to the main menu and then loaded back in again.\n\nSuddenly, about 1000 kg disappeared from my truck and 800 kg disappeared from my warehouse, yet all the progress on the actual ship appeared to be the same, with the same amount of parts removed as when I saved and left. Even the contracts got their values completely reset, meaning that I now have to start working on them all over again on a ship that is missing a lot of the parts that I need to complete them.\n\nFor some unknown reason, the bright afternoon that I saved on suddenly turned into pitch black midnight when I loaded back in, and I also noticed that when I turned the headlights on in my truck, the seats, door handles and other parts of the interior were glowing grey and perfectly visible in the complete darkness. The night is also way too dark and even with the flashlight on, I can barely see 3 meters in front of me.\n\n\nEdit 2: About 5 minutes later, I left-clicked on a shipping container for a crane to pick it up, but I looked away too soon and the game told me to \"point walkie-talkie on crane-able element\". So I did as the game said, but then the crane decided to not move anymore and now when I stand near the shipping container, it simply says \"Get off the crane-able element!\" and nothing is actually happening. I tried getting the chimney-thing from the roof of the ship using the crane, but the same thing happened.

They felt like scaled-down bosses with how crazy some of the attacks are and how often they change colors during chains. At some point I just skipped all the small guys just so I can get to the boss.\n- Fighting two enemies at a time was difficult (admittedly some skill issues on my end). It relates to how often they change colors + having to parry w/the right color. Maybe a difficulty option can be given so that pairs of enemies will only take one color each.\n- Having the Ability Points (AP) replenish based on 'enemies defeated' doesn't work with boss battles . Once I use up all my AP, I have no choice but to fight it w/the regular combat mechanics. The abilities are great and it's a shame I can't use them much during bosses. Replenishing them through (a couple of) parries would be a nice balance I think :D\n\nOverall, I still really enjoyed the game.

It's garbage and I love it and read the crappiest of stuff.\n\nBut this is just such a spit in the face to anyone who plays this game, whether you're my brand of weeb or not.\n\nIt's hard to even know where to begin, but if you're looking for my recommendation? No. Hard pass. Save yourself the time. Even if you're only in it for \"Those\" scenes, in my entire playtime I've encountered three of them and they were all hot garbage, with two of them being easily missed.\n\nSo, you're still here and wondering why I have a bone to pick? Okay, here's the deal.\n\nTheir coding is garbage. Screen sizes outside of standard (Or possibly even in standard 1920x1080, according to some forum posts) have UI issues, where half the UI is off the screen. Hoping for a fix? Not likely. Apparently this dev has a reputation for releasing and letting it burn.\n\nThe gameplay itself is hot garbage. I think the developers acknowledge this a bit by setting your default difficulty setting to \"Hard.\" I played on Normal, because I'm not here for the gameplay. Even so, it's offensive enough to be a giant time waster. The gameplay loop is to lead a single girl into a dungeon and play a Match-the-crystals game to deal damage to enemies. Your girl levels up. You take her to a higher level dungeon. Use the money to upgrade skills. Rinse and repeat. \n\nThere's a lot to unpack here, but the Matching game is absolutely boring. I lost exactly once in my time playtime and that's because I attempted a higher level dungeon (By one step) and got annihilated since I wanted to save time using the better skills my higher level girl had unlocked. Since there's only three lines on the matching board, there is no strategy. Mash the buttons and if you see four of the same crystal packed together click it.\n\nSkills offend me. They're vague by default and give you no indication of how much damage they actually do. (What does \"A lot of damage\" mean? Apparently not as much damage as my \"Normal damage\" starter move.)  You spend gold to upgrade them but it never feels like they get better because you can spend minutes playing a single battle in this matching game because the enemies are inflated stat sticks.\n\nThis is all compounded by the fact that the game hardly explains anything other than \"Match the crystals\" to you. Are quests useful? Not that I've seen. They give meager EXP and gold. You'll be spending hours trying to level up to get to the next story beat of five lines of dialogue to then do another dungeon to see five more lines of dialogue. And you have to do this for *every* girl you want to interact with. It gets boring in the first fifteen minutes and - to be clear - I never even reached top level with any of the girls or unlocked any of their specific CGs.\n\nThe story is by far the most offensive. Unique premise, sure. Instead of saving the world himself, the protag has to train the girls to beat them. But, spoiler warning, the story itself isn't consistent. At one point it's revealed that one of the girls in your party has a special debuff that makes it so they can't damage creatures stronger than them. Or was it weaker than them? I'm honestly not sure because in the same scene they used both variations. So it's a toss-up and you have no way of knowing because the author seems to switch between it as suits the strange, stupid story. \n\nIt's not even an exaggeration to say the story runs on \"Idiot Logic.\" At one point your character beds down for the night with no one on watch or on guard after several of your party members went off to fight in a dungeon. They get stabbed in their sleep after the girl who was an assassin apparently had a change of heart and had a nice loud fight right next to where the protag was sleeping. Obviously you didn't wake up. \n\nWho is the Demon Queen? No one knows or remembers because of a massive memory wipe for any and all info related to the Demon Queen. Why do they even need the protag if all it takes to beat the Demon Queen is just leveling up a lot? Who knows! I think what really rubs me wrong is that the short little slice of life cutscenes are not even synced to the story. You'll click to read the short scene and someone who hasn't joined your party yet will be there. Or people who are noted as specifically avoiding you will be there talking to you as if it was normal. Don't even get me started on the choices because they don't matter at all.\n\nOkay, okay. I'm being a bit harsh. The real draw here is the girls right? They might be nice... The swordswoman is alright, her personality boiled down to a trope of \"Fights for honor and wants to be stronger.\" The Magician is just an outright b****. She's listed as \"Tsundere\" but that's not Tsundere. That's psychopath. The kind of person even the yandere-lovers couldn't stand because there is no dere, only Tsun.\n\nThere are other girls, but they come later on and their personalities are forgettable except for the healer, who gets a lot of screen time and is a \"Priest with Daddy Issues and a dead fiance'.\" She's decent, but she's the only redeeming character in this game and she's given a lot less screen time than any of the other girls. They give the girls \"Level up\" chats as you level them and to say they don't make sense is being kind to the writer.\n\nThe only - and I mean the ONLY redeeming quality of this game is its artwork. It's for that reason you should just Google it. Save yourself the $20 or $15 if it's on sale and just google the artwork. I guarantee you you're not missing *anything* because the scenes are so badly written that sometimes your character will pop up and say something that was clearly meant to be the girls line and vice versa. It's mind-boggling how very little QA went into this.\n\nAnd if you really, really have to spend money on games with cute girls in it? Just go get Monster Girl 1,000.

I have no idea what these incompetent devs over at Saver are smoking but seriously get your shit together. The balance of this game is so survivor sided it's not even funny anymore.

Although its gameplay is nothing special, its story is compelling. Hannah is a professional photographer who traded her passion for life in exchange for the security of a steady paycheck. Despite the protest of her inner voice, she\u2019s expected to hold her tongue around her boss and clients, even when those clients deserve to be called out. We\u2019re all Hannah. Fein Games is a Berlin-based team who are expertly telling a universal story. And it\u2019s one that made me reflect on my own experiences. When Walker Scott touched Hannah\u2019s hair, I was surprised to feel a visceral reaction. As a man who has worked in the dance industry, I realized how quick I was to brush off inappropriate advances from my clients and think little of them. These advances may be something we all live with, that we all treat as a part of life, but it doesn\u2019t excuse them.\n\nFinding Hannah isn\u2019t just one story: it\u2019s three. It\u2019s the story of a generation who had no choice but to follow leaders whose country wronged the entire world. It\u2019s the story of that generation\u2019s children who wanted nothing more than to right a terrible wrong by making the world a better place. And it\u2019s the story of a generation who has gotten lost in the shuffle and forgotten the lessons learned by the previous generations.\n\nThe music\u2019s also pretty fantastic, featuring what I can best describe as pop jazz. Its simplicity fits the game and adds a layer of joy. As I said at the start, the gameplay is nothing special. Find objects either by their name, their silhouette, or instead click a bunch of flowers to mix it up. Combining items is much more satisfying in my opinion, and the pacing is fair.\n\nFind the object isn\u2019t my cup of tea.

Not a \"Press A to win\" game where you just go through the moves and steamroll the content. \n- Tactical gameplay reminded me of \"Into the Breach\" but with more variety because of the deck-building involved.\n- There are a lot of unique cards/spells that let you come up with interesting gameplay combinations.\n\nCon:\n- Still some serious bugs left (soft-locks, gameplay glitches when playing on non-standard resolutions) but support is very active and the devs already fixed a lot of the most aggravating bugs.\n- Not being able to save during a run. Which is worsened by the fact that runs can take for more than an hour if you take your time. Therefore, if your schedule is tight, it's hard to find a spot for this game.\n- Pacing seems a bit too open-ended. After the tutorial, you can already go to every dungeon without further introductions, which makes these dungeons seem a bit arbitrary. While the intro and looks of the game promise an immersive adventure, the story remained too basic for that - up until now.\n\nTl;dr: Despite these cons, this is one of the best games I've played in recent times.", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137416820", "app_id": "2281730", "review_text": "Teamates dogshit plz need ranked/skill based matchmaking plus report button", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137720377", "app_id": "1774580", "review_text": "game ran fine from the beginning. is quite fun, have had no crashes, combat is a blast and all the stances make it very diverse", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137468737", "app_id": "1623940", "review_text": "Quite an interesting game.\n\nThe gameplay wasn't challenging and the game mechanics were simple - but the game was fun nonetheless.\n\nThe books that you read during the game to get the story were really nicely illustrated.\n\nEnemy design was good and deaths were intensely brutal.\n\nAll in all a solid game, but with a very straightforward storyline.", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137476244", "app_id": "2359850", "review_text": "Mega City Police: Prelude is a Hardcore Action-Roglike in retro style/ Cool game!", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137623925", "app_id": "1869590", "review_text": "Pretty cool game, too bad its a moba", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137475380", "app_id": "1774580", "review_text": "Don't buy unless its fixed. it's not worth the issues.", "label": 0}, {"review_id": "137486084", "app_id": "1933180", "review_text": "Pixel pulp games - are just aesthetic orgasm! These wonderful retro sounds, cute graphics with special colours for every game of the series, mini-games and funny achivements...This game is a great example of good maked visual-novel and retro styled game. You can feel all this old-school horrors and slashers vibe, dialogues are really look like a living persons talking, characters are very good wroted and we can meet some of them here who was brought from Mothmen game (1st game of the Pixel pulp series.) Really nice to see such references and already builded universe of this games. The whole horror here isnt so obvious and scary. its like a mysthery and you should solve and understand it by yourself. Also i can say that this game is probably a little longer than Mothmen, whats really cool. There is many fun and nice cliches from old films, like men in black, ufo hunters, or goat-man. All these stuff create unique and great lore and vibe. Looking forward 3rd game! i hope you will make other games like these, after the trilogy. 10/10\n__________________________________________________\n\u0418\u0433\u0440\u044b

The dialogue is also laugh-out-loud funny; I definitely had to take a few moments to compose myself during parts of the story. And what's crazy is that this game is free! I highly recommend checking it out, I love the story to bits and while I'm happy with what's in the game, part of me is crazy and can't help but want for more (yuri player brainrot wants Ellys route LOL).", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137440128", "app_id": "1774580", "review_text": "Runs great after the patch, 3090+12700K, fluent 4K60 with plenty of room to spare.

This game though, as it is, is not.\n\nIt plays well, it has several characters to choose from, the enemies move and fight in a challenging, but generally fair way, even on Hard Mode where it feels like there's simply more enemies rather than stupid difficulty mechanics like turning up health.  It is a rogue-like, it scratches that itch, and it makes you want to play another round... until it doesn't.  I decided I wanted to beat Hard Mode to give the fairest review possible, but when I simply wanted to stop playing because the characters abilities, the weapon variety, the things that did make normal mode generally 'fun' stopped being a factor, can't say fairer than that.  Maybe it's weird to ultimately come to this conclusion based on the game's harder difficulty, it is supposed to be challenge, right?  Of course, but personally I think the game mechanics still need to *matter* and BE FUN.\n\nThe game allows you to shoot in every direction, move in every direction, and melee attack - that's true of every character; from there, depending on which character you choose, you may be able to dash, turn invisible/invulnerable, stun nearby enemies, and whatever the hell the Detective character is doing... he falls down?  I'm not sure.  Each character has a different 'ultimate' ability as well, from stunning all the enemies in the room for a short period of time, summon some robots to help you, or... put a laser sight on your gun... which is what some guns have already.  I'm being smarmy, but my problem is that the character variety feels like an afterthought to the gameplay design, as if the combat, tempo, AI, and overall mechanics were entirely designed for the starter \"Rookie\" character and it was a struggle to design a gameplay identity for the others.  In my opinion, all of the characters should at least, generally, *move* the same, this is the crux of the gameplay and combat and it's simply not fun to just drop to the floor to avoid some damage as the Detective when you can do the same thing AND turn invisible as the Scout.\n\nHealth and damage is another issue, again it feels like this was designed around Rookie, and dashing around bullets to not get hit - playing as the Cyborg gives you no damage mitigation options except for a slightly higher health, making the character an insane choice in the harder mode.  The numbers themselves kind of reflect this absurdity: with the Rookie's standard Lawgiver Pistol you're doing around 7 dmg to enemies, then you pick up a bazooka and do a whopping... 18 damage.  You start to see this underwhelming damage increase across the board with the majority of weapons, making what should be one of the most exciting things in the game - opening chests for new weapons - to feel like a wet fart.\n\nAnother issue that impacts this is the accuracy of weapons; shooting at where your mouse pointing *doesn't necessarily mean your bullets are going to go where your mouse is pointing*, with the exception of a few weapons in game which will be dead-on accurate.  But again, playing the Hard Mode will have you question why, it seems like a silly and arbitrary mechanic rather than making you feel like you are succeeding or failing on your own abilities to move, aim, and use your abilities.  There is no 'compensating' for this, but rather just 'accepting' it.\n\nAnd THIS wouldn't be so much of a problem if it weren't for the amount of ammunition you get.  The game has no 'default' weapon, you can certainly run out of ammo and be left with a melee attack that you can't spam, so the idea of your bullets going catty-wampus 'just because' means each of those bullets that don't hit their target are just taken from you.  The game might as well not even draw them in, just randomly make each shot I fire cost a random amount of ammunition, the same result is being accomplished.\n\nAnd god help you if you have to rely on any melee attack - they are useless in the game because the melee enemies will almost always get a hit on you if you decide to swat at them.  Sure would be nice to ninja around with that Katana you picked up, yeah?  Wrong!  You chose poorly, there goes a quarter of your health from one melee hit that you couldn't have avoided, guess you learned not to use melee - don't worry, there's a bunch of melee weapons in the game though so look forward to that being another disappointment when you see one drop from a chest.\n\nIf it seems like I'm being harsh it's because I can see what this game COULD BE, but it is a ways away from that right now.  I will be watching closely though, I hope these sort of things are tuned up in the release product.", "label": 0}, {"review_id": "137614369", "app_id": "2128270", "review_text": "Please ignore the playtime as I played the demo version a lot before Early Access.  \n\nThis game really took me in.  It seemed kind of simple at first, but easy to learn and fun.  But over time the complexity started to reveal itself.  Then it became about strategy and building different kinds of characters.  Using some tried and true build types slowly allows the player to progress past the various levels, only to realize there is some missing piece.  \n\nThis was one of my first experiences with the rogue (like/lite) genre since playing Dunzhin back in the 1980s.  More recently I did enjoy playing Vampire Survivors, to which this game bears some similarities.  However, where that game seemed to provide a lot of surface level enjoyment with very little depth, this game makes you think and plan out your moves much more carefully, both on the battlefield and when building your character's skills and choosing their weapons.  \n\nIt is that combination of items you find, and skills that you assign, along with the initial skills set by your race, class and religion, that seems to be the most interesting part of the game.  Learning which items effect they gameplay and how to recognize them is super important.  It rewards repeat playthroughs and basically learning the lore, so while it all seems a bit random at first, you will gain new insights with each playthrough IF you are paying attention.  That's where I feel the game excels, and demonstrates its depth.  \n\nI also like the relatively short games.  Each time you set out on the path, you may die very quickly or get pretty far.  There is some randomness to it, and that keeps it exciting.  Even as someone who has won the game, I still find the early levels quite challenging sometimes.  \n\nAnyway I strongly recommend this game.", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137555776", "app_id": "1623940", "review_text": "10/10 loved it", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137507438", "app_id": "986130", "review_text": "In short, yes, when it's done.\n\nLong, it has a lot of quest breaking bugs at the moment, such as the Case hand in location is placed in a weird location.

Each monster has a different set of moves that requires Action Points (APs) to use, In a battle, at the beginning of each turn, each monster regenerates a number of APs that then can be spent on these moves. \n\nThe moves are customisable as transferrable stickers from one monster to another. Some moves are rarer than others or can only be obtained from certain monsters, so there's an element of \"looter-monster catcher\" here.\n\nThe monster designs aren't the typical elemental animals seen in Pokemon or other similar games. The cassette beasts draw upon the shapes of both inanimate objects and animals or plants. In terms of typing, there are the usual fire, water, earth, and wind, plus metal, poison, and plastics. There are many, fresh interactions between these types. There are 120 monsters in the game and they can be fused together, resulting in 14,000 different combinations.\n\nI can go on but I'll simply conclude this now.

Maybe 15 minutes if you have to take your time and think carefully for whatever reason. \n\nThen you go to the next floor where you can hit a shrine to save and now you can save quit. So basically unless you can't play for 15 minutes at a time max, the save quit issue is non-existent.\n\nNow there are two issues that I do agree with, but they aren't a huge problem, at least for me.\n1. Controller Support.\nI started off playing on controller since I wanted to chill out a little bit more but it's quite finicky and one of the minigames doesn't work with it. However, I found playing on mouse and keyboard a lot better overall since it's a lot quicker to transition through the screens/see enemy attack patterns/etc.\n2. Deckbuilding Management\nYou currently can't name your decks which honestly is kind of needed, and I really hope the devs change this.

The closest is the expedition balloon, where you give up a colonist for some in-game hours, afterwards being presented with a dialog to choose between outcome A or outcome B. Lacks any depth.\n* \"Raid\" events are always bugs, with no AI variety as the game progresses, simply more and/or beefier bugs who are more than happy to always run through your flamethrower and trap kill lane. Very easy to cheese and make trivial.\n* While elevating buildings is possible thanks to the 3D space, surprisingly multi-level buildings are not. Sometimes building at a higher elevation is forced based on the terrain, but a room with different terrain heights won't be able to share a roof and still be considered \"indoors\".

Cassette Beasts seems to target an audience who look for strategy in the game-play, being able to mix and match abilities and monsters in many ways that make for a challenging and creative experience that Pokemon doesn't fulfil for me.\nThat said I still have a nostalgic element for Pokemon and CB seems to understand that there will be many people in the same shoes. The art style is derivative but the artists made their own creative spin, allowing for whacky and wonderful creature designs that leave me wanting to see them all.\n\nThe way you traverse the world is interesting and also allows you to be creative with the tools they leave laid all over the sandbox. Some measures seems exploitative but also will make for interesting speedruns and are very rewarding if you pull them off.\n\nThe world is a vibrant place with varied biomes to explore. Most are characterised with typical the wilderness aesthetics that you see in other JRPGs of this style but are made interesting and lively with the world shifting and changing, albiet in small ways, as you go along. This makes the world feel alive and a run out into the wild won't always be run of the mill when revisiting.\n\nThe characters are all well designed and each one feels very unique and distinct from the others you encounter. That said not all of the stories felt like they held as much gravitas as they should considering how the characters react in kitschy or quirky ways to facilitate a lightheartedness. For example, a character reacting to another character's death, the reaction is basically \"oh they should have known that was coming\".\nAnd whilst everyone was from different worlds I do feel like everyone felt like they came from our planet and year, save a few key exceptions. This was also driven by some \"internetty\" humour, puns and the like, which isn't my sort of thing but, that is subjective. It never made me want to turn off the game, there were, simply, moments I felt could be taken more serious without taking away from the cartoony vibe the developers have conjured up.\nThe style of the art also deviates from the style in certain places. Without going into spoilers, it is a wonderful abstraction that allows some very unique moments for a game like this.\n\nThe rearing of monsters does feel more connected than compared to Pokemon, a welcome feature for me, as you can really find beasts that match the play style your looking for. I would love to see more individuality of each player's monsters do they can really feel they belong to you and not necessarily an abundance in adding more and more creatures, in the future.\n\nCassette Beasts, obviously, gets its inspiration from Pokemon but really does become its own thing.

Trial and error gameplay comes with the territory of the cinematic platformer genre--however, when failures are more the result of finicky controls and readability than the player's own quick reflexes, that challenge becomes frustrating and harms the immersion these games typically strive for.\n\nDespite the technical flaws, this game is definitely a breath of fresh air for the genre. Creepy throughout and took me by surprise multiple times. Incredible music, too. There was clear vision in the creative direction, and it's executed really well... except there's not as much literal clear vision in the camera's depth of field; very often nothing is in focus.

I like that leveling up is based on your CHARACTER and not your MONSTERS, it not only makes sense given that you are transforming into the monster but it really reduces the amount of grind needed overall and lets you focus on the more fun parts of the game, scanning monsters and building movesets. And finally the music is fantastic, really A+ job.\n\nMy only complaint about this game is that there's no online aspect yet.

There are some nice improvements, notably there is a single player component, and graphically it's a better-looking game. The real issue I have with it is that even with a Singleplayer campaign, it will live and die on the support from the CoOp audience. At $69, with many folks being let down with AAA PC releases in the past couple of months, a large portion will be holding off until substantial discounts for the game start hitting. This has me on the fence around recommending it at this point, unless you have Xbox Gamepass and just essentially play free for the next few months, then see where the Steam audience stands towards the end of summer.\n\nOtherwise, my thoughts on the Steam Deck performance are good. It usually runs in the 40 - 50 fps range (It can dip to 30fps and climb to 60fps) and looks good on low settings with FSR 2.1. My main concern, again, is that the lack of audience will be problematic for Steam players early on. I have a poll up on my channel, and about 4% of the votes say they will buy the game on Steam. It's not 1000s of votes, but it will likely end up with hundreds of votes, and if it tracks anywhere near other new release polls I've done, it will stay in the single digits. If that holds true, it won't make me feel fantastic about paying such a high price out of the gate.\n\nYou can check out the Steam Deck footage for the game above and vote on the poll while you're there!\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\ud83c\udfaeeeFoGee\ud83c\udfae\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42825155/] Factor of Games Curator Page[/url]", "label": 0}, {"review_id": "137484977", "app_id": "1774580", "review_text": "when Rancor stomps frames go brrrrrr", "label": 0}, {"review_id": "137627505", "app_id": "1324130", "review_text": ".", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137672749", "app_id": "1623940", "review_text": "8/10 - Highly recommended for those who are into this kind of atmosphere, suspense, and horror.

The character models of the boy and girl appear slightly 'cartoonish\" (not sure if i'm using the correct term here, they appear plastic) which kind of worked but I feel the game's atmosphere and level of immersion may have benefited from these characters having a more \"realistic\" art style.", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137266380", "app_id": "986130", "review_text": "This game is very immersive and there are so many things to interact with.

The game's graphics are simply breathtaking, with beautifully rendered environments and detailed character models that bring the story to life.\n\nOne of the standout features of the game is its unique gameplay mechanics, which require the player to solve complex puzzles and investigate clues in order to progress through the story. This adds an element of challenge and depth to the game, making it more than just a simple Metroidvania adventure.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the game can be somewhat glitchy at times, which can be frustrating for players. This is particularly noticeable in some of the more complex sequences, where the game's mechanics can sometimes feel clunky or unresponsive.\n\nDespite these issues, the game's storyline is nothing short of fantastic. It's a gripping and suspenseful tale that keeps the player hooked from start to finish, with plenty of twists and turns along the way.\n\nOverall, \"The Last Case of Benedict Fox\" is an impressive and enjoyable game that is well worth checking out. Despite some minor glitches, the game's stunning visuals and unique gameplay make it a standout title in the genre. Highly recommended for fans of mystery and adventure games.", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137568405", "app_id": "1774580", "review_text": "can't get higher than 30 fps do not bye", "label": 0}, {"review_id": "137465213", "app_id": "1321440", "review_text": "I'm just gonna come right out of the gate and say these 4 words about the game:  Quality of Life Improvements\n\nMovement is so wonky.  Jumping and gliding and dashing all do not feel very smooth.  There are many times I get frustrated because I can't quite make the jump or move fast enough.  \n\nYou can only change your party while resting.  They don't really tell you this until you remove a party member from your party in the middle of nowhere and then you're left with a huge gaping hole in your roster because of this.  Why can't I just switch out between battles?  \n\nThere are places you can quick travel to but in some of those places, you have to go a few screens to get out of the train station and then off to wherever you wish to go in the over world.  Why isn't this more consistent so that I can plan my travels more accordingly?  \n\nSome puzzles are just wayyyyy too obscure for anyone to get.  For instance, in the thirstalot chamber, I unlocked all of the puzzles and got a key.  Only for there to be one last puzzle to stand in my way.   I know that this might sound silly but I thought all of the puzzles were solved for the main line once I grabbed the key and opened up what I needed to.   NO!  There's one last puzzle and the only clue is far off in another room with a depiction of the same puzzle you had to do earlier!  \n\nNo point in grinding levels as the whole world levels up as you level.  This is understandable as this is basically an open world map.  However, it's slightly annoying when at one point you were one-shotting the trash mobs and now you have to 2 hit them because you and your allies have leveled up.  I'd rather they just stay the hell away from me if I'm 30+ levels above it.  Or at least just stay put.  \n\nThis game suffers from the \"same party syndrome\".  Why should I switch out my party members when clearly leveling them all up together and creating beautiful synergies with them is the way to go!?  I basically got my 10 poke...I mean cassettes that I will switch in and out depending on which secondary I take with me and that's it.  \n\nSpeaking of builds, there are some digi...err cassettes types that are clearly better than the rest.  Lightening types are hands down the best, and if they are weak against lightening.. ouch time.  \n\nThere are some unique strategies that can play out... HOWEVER...  trash mobs are normally 1 or 2 shotted making you very ill prepared to fight boss battles.  Get ready to have your cassettes consistently knocked out as those boss battles are ALWAYS difficult, these fights will take huge chunks of health off of your guys rendering many predefined plans laid to waste.   \n\nForget about healing skills as rewinds and roll backs are the way to go.  As previously mentioned, the trash fights are a joke but the boss fights are so difficult that casting one heal will actually set you back too far.   Better to just use rewinds and heal all the way up when low.  \n\nLots of times the quests will put a plot down on the map of where to go.  That's great, until you get there and you are still scratching your head thinking: WTF?  Once again, there are times which go unexplained on what needs to be done.  For instance, go check out a metal lady.  Are they talking about the robot that needs a coin??? Ah yes..... they were.   There's a whole separate quest/rumor for the coin so it's a bit confusing.  \n\nNow you may say to me: Hey VG - you gave this game a thumbs up but all I see are big time complaints.  Well...Yes, but it's because underneath all of these QoL issues, there's actually a pretty good in depth game here.  Sure things could be smoother and things could be more readily accessible but there's a lot of fun to be had here.  Try messing up your party synergy to put in this new cassette and see how much fun you'll get from trying to make it work.  Getting lost on the overworld map is good fun as there are a lot of puzzles to figure out.  Even moving objects around and jumping on them trying to get to new places is eye opening.   \n\nTLDR:  More quality of life fixes are needed but a diamond in the rough.\n", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137667978", "app_id": "1277920", "review_text": "I just could not get past the inability to walk diagonally.

AI is very janky, they will usually have no object permanence and ignore me if I break line of sight even if I'm trespassing, but if I dare take one step too far into someone's apartment they'll sometimes pull a weapon on me and never stop chasing me throughout the city. I've also experienced a lot of weirdness with how the game handles clues, where I'll have a fingerprint for someone and have a profile for them, but be unable to link it to some other evidence because one has their full name and the other has only their first name. Maybe I'm just obtuse, but I also can't figure out a sane way to get peoples' fingerprints and link them to the actual person. Seemingly the only way is to scan their actual hand, but everyone will refuse to get scanned if asked and trying to scan anyway is considered a hostile action.

I know one review said to just keep at it, but it doesn't feel very rewarding at the start of the game, unlike other roguelites that usually boost you up with meta upgrades [i]just[/i] enough to feel like you're getting somewhere. It's small, but that little boost makes losing the next run feel much less crushing. I took a damage boost, but I was doing enough damage regardless, and my struggle seemed more like staying alive. Heals are few and far between and I felt pretty on edge needing to play perfectly to progress farther.\n\nThat coupled with another review that said all nanite upgrades and weapons are reset upon advancing to the next difficulty, that's just soul crushing. I don't want to get all that way and then have to upgrade all of that [i]again[/i].\n\nThese are just personal gripes, though, and if this game sounds appealing to you regardless I would say go for it.

It's not slow like stardew valley, where you always are trying to move forward with new technology and money, trying to build the town, etc. In this game.. you have the clan contribution, but I just don't think it really invests me. \nSo the first issue is some of the contribution \"milestones\" don't mean anything to the player. Like \"Laundry\" which as far as I can tell right now, does literally nothing for us. Or a \"southern contribution box\" that just has another box to the south of your area, within a 5 secondish walk time. That really means nothing to the player, so most days I either felt like I was roaming around aimlessly, or spamming the fishing so I can get more contribution points.\nThe next issue is that the people you talk to just feel...soulless? For some reason I am really not invested in the people or their stories, I think it's just because you don't really get any quests that interact with them much and most things are just shared in one sentence and hollowed out.\nAnother pacing issue is how quickly new areas open up.. but there is almost nothing to do in those areas. Yes a few new people, yes more fish and flowers, but within a few minutes you already have the entire new section figured out and no longer any new feelings.  \nI think it's the pacing and the atmosphere of the game itself that kills it for me.

Arrived at the murder scene, there's a big message written with the victim's blood on the wall. Sadly, I couldn't read what it was since it was clipping through the shower door and the curtains... Anyway, after that, I discovered a paper near the victim that says \"Let's play a game\" and there's a bunch of letters on it. It was kind of an anagram. I couldn't figure it out at the time, so I just proceeded by doing the usual. Taking fingerprints, examining the body, searching for clues, etc. I discovered that the victim was killed with a hunting rifle. At this point, I knew that when following graffiti, it could lead to criminal places, like drug dealers or weapon dealers, etc.\n\nAfter some times, I found this weapon dealers place. I decided to knock but no one answered. So, I decided to lock-pick the door and trespass. I went to one of the file cabinet and found a purchase history book or whatever. After browsing through it, I found a guy named J. Fletcher that bought .309 ammo. (If I remember correctly) Then, it hit me. I remembered the anagram! I opened it and the letters were FTJRELREC. So, I knew it was him.\n\nAfter that, I discovered where he lived, his phone number, his work schedule and everything I needed to know. After his work shift, I saw him go no where near where he lived. I decided to follow him! After a couple of minutes, he knew that I was following him. This is where I ran at him and handcuff this pathetic murderer.[i]\n\n---\n\nI just want to point out some of the cons this game has.\n\n- Bugs and performance issues.

It's a bit annoying to save every 5-10 minutes, so you don't lose your progress by an annoying bug or whatever.\n\n- Everytime you enter or leave a building, there's a .5 seconds freeze.\n\n- Probably becomes repetitive after a few hours.

Seems to only have 18 Disks (passives) to play with.\n\nBut apart from that, the game is great. It's a lot of fun. I cannot wait to see what's in store for the future!

The monster designs are cool and complex. They feel unique despite how many similar games are out there. Even though some of the fusions are similar to each other, most of them look super cool. \n\nThe battle mechanics are simple to understand but have enough nuance to keep you entertained throughout the game(I have not finished mind you, 13 hours in). The type advantages are more than just damage based but actually produce status effects and interact in interesting ways. An example of this is when a fire type move his a plastic type barrier. Instead of taking 3 hits to break, it breaks after one punch. Landing a fire attack on an ice type actually changes them to a water type! \n\nThats not to say that its perfect. It has quirks and some battles can run quite long. Certain enemies stall and the battle runs on too long. Although a real strategy in many turn-based games like this, it can get pretty annoying when it happens. \n\nMy other gripe is that the campsites where you can heal are few and far between. On such a large map, its annoying to backtrack to a campsite every time i need to heal. The cap on healing items only makes it worse. \n\nThe battles have more nuance and you can rarely knock out a monster in one hit. That's part of the draw of the battle system, but at the same time it means even low level monsters can take it's toll on the team after a few encounters. Not to mention the scaling of the monsters can be quite brutal at times. \n\nThat said, those are my only gripes with an otherwise amazing game.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, the story is interesting and the characters are fun. The relationship system is simple but it works to its advantage. \n\nThe sidequest system is interesting and keeps you on your toes. Random rumors will guide you across the large map, starting in the east and gradually moving to the west side. Guided just enough to not feel aimless but doesn't feel restrictive. \n\nI also enjoyed the funny parts of the story like hidden easter eggs and such. I won't spoil anything. \n\nSome have touched on a horror element. While it does kinda exist, it's never really the focus nor expanded too far. The area bosses/main story bosses are frightening in form and the glitchy effects are reminiscent of a some horror games. Don't go into this expecting a horror game. It's mostly fun and wholesome. \n\nI wholeheartedly think anyone who's a fan of turn-based combat and this genre of  monster catching give this game a try. Well worth the price tag. I was expecting maybe 10-15 hours of gameplay but it seems I'll probably get more like 20-25. Perhaps more if there is some sort of endgame. \n\nFinally, the best part of the game. THE SOUNDTRACK. Damn is it good. Every single track is a bop. There's even vocals in some of them and they sound awesome. In fact the sound design is better than 99% of the games out there. Although some characters grunts are a little sus.\n\nAmazing game 9/10. The entire game is a vibe. Feels like a proper evolution of the monster catching genre. From the 2.5D to the battle mechanics, it more than separates itself from similar games.\n\nEDIT:\nAfter reading other reviews, it seems I missed a lot of settings. Apparently you can change difficulty settings AND level scaling. So completely scratch out that complaint.

As of right now the price is worth it if you want to support the developers, but not quite worth it for what you get.\n\nThe game is a mix of grand strategy, tactical command, and first person shooter gameplay. The fps gameplay is fun enough, if a little arcadey for the type of game this is. Time to kill is low and the weapons have some good punch, but the AI is not at the point where you can really call this game tactical. Movement and shooting isn't precise enough for you to be tactical at an individual level, and the AI on both sides do very little to keep themselves alive. AI won't take cover often, have problems spotting each other, and tend not to engage at long distance. The maps aren't large enough to make use of terrain, and the tactical camera can't be zoomed out far enough to get a good view of the whole map. There are no options for formations, so any kind of movement ends up being a blob of infantry and vehicles, to the point where tactics are a relatively minor aspect of the game.\n\nOn the strategy map things are relatively obtuse. The importance of the various resources aren't made clear, diplomacy is difficult to grasp beyond the basics of trading and war, and the lack of any tooltips on what research, weapons, buildings, etc do leaves you with very little information. In general the game is very information poor, there are no stat pools for units or weapons, and learning how to do something as simple as creating a new army can be frustrating. The game needs new UI to give the player more information, and a proper tutorial.\n\nWhen the game works and the stars align for a battle, the game is a ton of fun, especially with some of the bigger toys, but if you're a fan of tactical shooters and strategy gameplay, this one isn't worth the 30 bucks quite yet.", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137415513", "app_id": "1321440", "review_text": "I'm not really a fan of Pok\u00e9mon clones (I've only played a few), but this one is great.

It is hard after 25h of play to not think this was just a cash grab to abuse the trust of idiots like me who have played GalCiv since its inception. Stardock, you have lost my trust and respect. If you want it back you are going to have to work hard, but pretty sure you won't.\n\nPretty disappointing. I didn't realize the game had been out for a year on Epic and I saw the \"Supernova\" and just thought \"holy crap, GalCiv released a new game and it already has DLC and I didn't even know?!\" and bought it sight unseen because I've been playing since the original, why wouldn't I?\n\nIt did not take long at all to realize the game was giving those tale-tale signs of incomplete, very early access, slow/poor development, but I ignored it because they were minor things at first (like typos, lots of typos/simple grammar issues). \n\nThen the game-play... It feels flat. Maybe because it's been half a decade since I've played any GalCiv. Maybe it's because actually good 4x games are out these days like Stellaris and we've all seen how it can be better, more complex, more meaningful depth.\n\nTechnology: There is no agency to technology and I feel you just grab whatever technology you want and there really is little to no reason to not take what you want when you want. Now I was playing a xenophobic race so strong the on the tech, but that is what I have always played so I have a good feel for it I think. It feels bad and meaningless though. Also it seems very OP and I even turned off tech trading to create a handicap and it doesn't matter. Just out tech military and nobody can fight you. ggez. boring af.\n\nPlanets: There is little diversity to planets. They all are the same thing and everything gets taken up so incredibly fast. All of the AI is just pre-programmed to only build colony ships and everything, even those crappy little 5s get grabbed up immediately. Secondly, there really doesn't seem to be much matter for volcanic or oceanic planets and stuff. All planets just seem like all planets, which is honestly fine, but you still have the section for research on it and either get rid of that stuff or lean into it, but it just feels like we're in this wishy washy part and it makes little sense. \n\nInfluence: Every round seems like influence is a much bigger part than I always remember, I don't have any actual complaint about this, but it doesn't feel right to me and I understand how useless that is.\n\nWorld building: It seems like a lot of options are just not there that should be or used to be in previous games. Why can't I have more granular controls? Also, more importantly, the way little sections of the galaxies are created is very unsatisfying, maybe my understanding of the settings are wrong, but I felt it doesn't work the way it seems and I'm not sure I'm going to play a third massive world to confirm.\n\n\nAI: While the AI stuff needs a bit of work and tweaking, it is a really cool concept and overall well used for this kinda style of game. Clever and I like it and hope to see more of that kinda thing.\n\nRoadmap: The roadmap is this: Translate into other languages, release race (something that can be made in minutes), translate into other language, release race (something that takes minutes), translate into language, make changes based on community complaints, repeat. There is no vision other than get as many people to buy the game as possible. I hope I am wrong, but they're going to have to do a lot of work to prove me wrong at this point.\n\nAll in all the game just feel linear or flat. Strategy is flat. The races don't really feel all that different. I don't know I just got bad vibes and after 25h while I haven't played any game in this style in awhile, I am going to install Stellaris to just like... cleanse my palette.

There's some plusses and minuses but I need to directly compare it to SDV because it's absolutely learning on that game's foundations.\n\n[h1]Notable plusses:[/h1]\n\nThe quests (\"ideas\" and the like) are [i]interesting[/i]. They all give you tangible benefits and have fit the characters reasonably.\n\nThe levelling mechanic is nice. \"Discoveries\" and \"knowledge\" let you gain new info about plants as you harvest more of them which leads to (automatic) domestication and more info about how they grow. It's really got that neolithic feeling to it.\n\nThe mines are puzzle and progression-based rather than combat-based, which is [i]fresh[/i], I'm happy to see that instead of janky combat or pure grind mines.\n\nThe whole communalism thing is very fresh, it's a lot cozier than living off on your own trying to corner the cabbage market. Levelling up \"your\" buildings means levelling up the whole village. \"Your\" farms, \"your\" animals are really the village's as a whole. You don't \"sell\" goods, you \"contribute\" them for the good of everyone.\n\nAnimals are a bit more interesting, there's more to do with them at least.\n\nCharacters have [i]a lot of lines[/i] and are reactive to changes happening. They've also got more defined roles to play within the village, some of which are directly important to you (e.g. the toolmaker), some of which are just good for flavor.\n\nHotfixes for issues have been coming [i]fast[/i] since release which is nice to see.\n\nController support is flawless, it's better than SDV was at launch, maybe better than it is even in its current state.\n\n[h1]Minuses?[/h1]\n\nSo far, the characters don't seem to have much personality. I'm just now starting to hit the first \"heart events\" and it's opening them up [i]a bit[/i], but for the most part they still seem really 1-dimensional, and their dialogue is bland and humorless. Most farming games seem to have kind of bland character dialog aside from maybe RF4 so this maybe isn't too big a deal for most people. I think it's probably still miles above the Story of Seasons games.\n\nThe new regions open up [i]fast[/i], it seems like they all do within the first season, and there's [i]almost nothing to do in them[/i]. You also meet almost everyone from outside the village within the first season. I'm wondering what, if anything, they saved for other seasons/years (but I'm still too early to call this, maybe they've got more rabbits to pull out of their hats).\n\nThe biggest problem is just that the game is [i]too similar[/i] to SDV; it needs more uniqueness to shake things up.

Due to the nature of the game, rather than over-levelling, you must employ strategy.

Don't like what their current abilities are? No worries. Rip those stickers off and slap on some stellar ones in their place and customise with super rare and uncommon variants to empower them even further than before. \n\nYou can find these from the merchants that restock their stores every night/day. So gathering resources from beasts and quests help set you up for more powerful stickers to make the following battles even more trivial.

The possibilities are endless. Find a glitter version? That'll also effect it's color. Joy! \n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\nThe game is worth the price and is very cozy.

I enjoyed my time with it. If you haven't played those two games then I'll explain the gameplay style below this sentence as succinctly as possible.\n\nThe main goal is to capture the enemy Headquarters, Airstrip, and/or Naval Yard. These are the structures that produce units. You can produce units on these structures once per turn if you have the cash. Capturing buildings makes you generate more income. Combat is based on a typical rock-paper-scissors format with unit typing. That is the gist of it!\n\n[b][u]How does combat feel?[/u][/b]\nThe combat is fairly intuitive, but there needs to be some clarification work down on its exact breakdown which I will cover in my suggestion section at the bottom. An infantry stack will deal 5 damage to a fellow infantry stack. The enemy's stack will strike back and also deal 4-5 to you, depending on terrain. Every unit has a strength applicable to each unit type. Infantry for example will deal often 0-1 damage to a tank, but 3-5 to light vehicles. Airplanes for the most part seem to have very little counter except the anti-air vehicle and other airplanes. If you control your airplanes well then the enemy AI will struggle to deal with it. There is also a rank up system, the more kills your units get the higher ranks they can achieve (or maybe its based on cost of enemy unit? not sure) then the more strength they get. Normally speaking a bomber can't one shot an anti air vehicle, but a ranked bomber can. This means you can stick a bomber on top of the enemy spawner and ensure they can't make units anymore.\n\n[b][u]How does money generation feel?[/u][/b]\nMoney is generated based on buildings captured. The enemy AI during the campaigns will start with all buildings captured so typically you will rely on the combat AI making odd decisions to push through the missions. The more buildings you get the beefier units you can make - its very snowbally. For the most part you aren't going to have an issue generating units and maintaining a solid frontline as long as you pull units back properly to get healed.\n\n[b][u]Overall how do I feel about the game?[/u][/b]\nI enjoyed the game. It reminded me a lot of Advanced Wars and that's a game type that kind of fell off the radar in favor of stuff like civilization which i'm not fond of. Its much more bite-sized and faster paced. Something you can sit down with for a short period of time and enjoy it. Not sure why people tagged this with 4x as it is not even remotely a 4x game. 4x is for economy and empire building like civ or sins or master of orion. There is no empire building nor technological advancement, no diplomacy, and no research tree.\n\n[b][u]Suggestions for the game[/u][/b]\nJust wanted a brief note of things I feel can improve the game QoL style.\n[list]\n[*] -Enemy units should be clickable so I can see their unit typing and damage values\n[*] -The camera feels a bit floaty. When I release the camera pan button it should immediately kill any momentum.\n[*] -Headquarters are too easy to capture; a unit should be able to be bought and placed within the surrounding hexes instead of just on the building itself. This allows the AI or player to station a garrison while still producing units without juggling them. Just make it so the Headquarters can only produce one unit per turn to avoid shenanigans. \n[*] -Having to right click to deselect a unit before clicking a new unit feels clunky. Have an option to just select a newly clicked friendly unit without deselection.\n[*] -Unsure of interaction between health and damage. Create a tutorial missions for this please. It doesn't feel like there is any downside to having low health units.\n[*] -(opinion)1 turn capture seems a bit quick to me since there is no detriment to it. You can also capture after exhausting movement and attacking. Personal bias but I feel capturing should cost either movement or attack action. Or perhaps disable unit retaliation during capture.\n[*] -(opinion)Ranged artillery is quite beefy and feels slightly imbalanced. Minus 1 ranged to all artillery would feel a bit better.\n[*] -An explanation of how terrain affects vision and targeting during one of the tutorials would be keen.\n[/list]\n\nContains first four missions.

I'm not a diehard supporter, having only heard of it two weeks ago, but it has SWALLOWED my BRAIN. SEND HELP. I can't stop thinking about PoA. I can't stop optimizing my builds. So many classes! So many cultures! So many gods, and skills, and weapons, and prestige classes, and combinations, AAAAAA!\n\nPoA is almost like a beautiful response to games in the AAA space. So many games are all about vomiting story and exposition and long cutscenes and other bullspit at the player, but PoA says NO. \"You are a nomad. There is a flood. You are trying to outrun it. Now move from left to right on this world map and kill a morbillion enemies to beat the final boss to save the world or something! Who cares? Make a dude/dudette and bash some heads!\"\n\nThe game is far from complete, with the lead dev Ulfsire (You'll hear his name a lot) having posted all sorts of plans for what to add in the future. Even so, what is currently in the Steam EA is already more than good enough to give you tens of hours of fun replayability as you try to perfect your builds and climb the difficulty ascensions. It was good in the demo, and I still haven't had time to swallow the HUGE amount of additions he made to the EA release.\n\nCultures, classes, and gods in the demo:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/fktaegL.png\n\nCultures, classes, and gods in Steam Early Access:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/S4XZVso.png\n\nSkills in the demo:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/s8eXtj5.png\n\nSkills in Early Access:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/FtDEPSm.png\n\nHe also added a bunch of new weapons and items, a few Prestige classes for when you hit a certain number of skill points assigned to specific nodes...\n\nThis game is all about customization. You build a starting character, assign stats to them, equip weapons and armor, and try to build a powerful synergy that will ultimately win a run. A typical run usually takes me about 40 minutes, so it's not a big time commitment. If you want a quick game you can play on your lunch break, this feels perfect. You can also save a run and close the game, then reload it to get right back to the monster destruction.\n\nThe game isn't perfect. I've already brought a lot of balancing concerns to Ulfsire's attention, and he will be working on adding lots of new features and other such things to address these concerns. In no particular order:\n\n- Runs can be a bit RNG-based, especially at higher ascension difficulties. If you need a core item to get your build working, but you don't get it early, you'll die in the first elite fight.\n- Is your character weak to a certain element type, like Astral? Too bad! Here's a forced Astral node where all the enemies deal +100% damage to you!\n- Did you build your damage around fire or some other specific element? Here's a node where all the enemies have 90% fire resistance. Whoops!\n\nMost of the time, if you're going to die, you'll die early before your build takes off and you get your key items. This is always frustrating, but at the same time, it's only 5-10 minutes lost and you can restart a character and try again quite easily. In time, these balance issues will be addressed.\n\nPoA is not perfect, but it really stands out in a sea of AAA garbage and steam shovelware/mediocrity. For a first time developer, this is a stellar game you won't regret buying. And it's only $10! What a steal! I'd have paid $15 for it, easily!\n\nIf you want to get more good games out in the world, SUPPORT GOOD DEVS!

The game takes away a lot of convenient behaviour we, me included, got used to in the genre:\nInvincibility Frames from dodging? Nope.\nInvincibility Frames while attacking? Nope too. \nAttack Canceling? What even is that? Take a swing = take a risk. \nExpect that you might get hit if you attack into an enemies attack at the same time you are attacking. Same is true for both sides though, so you may cancel out an attack by hitting the enemy with good timing.\nI cant count how often I died in this game, because I tried to \"forward dodge\" through an enemies bullet or tried to smash from right above them while they were executing an attack. ;)  \nBut honestly: I am aware thats a fault of MINE and my expectations, not of the game. If anything it makes me aware of how dependant my play has become of those convenient behaviours I have come to expect from games, which give the hero of a metroidvania some super-fast super-super qualities, but may or may not reduce the challenge quite a bit?\nI do believe it makes combat more \"believable\" though and makes the protagonist more fragile and human, adding to the atmosphere, and, in the end, fitting ~this~ game and its story environment.\n\nAnyhow. \n\nIf you are able to look a bit beyond what your expectations about controls of a polished Metroidvania ~should~ have from your point of view, you might find quite an enjoyable and atmospheric adventure in this game. \nI personaly do think story, riddles and art are well crafted (at least until the point I am now) and I am curious on how it progresses.\n\nMight update the review when I finished the game.", "label": 1}, {"review_id": "137417785", "app_id": "986130", "review_text": "zzzzzzzzzzzz i eeep", "label": 0}, {"review_id": "137552638", "app_id": "1321440", "review_text": "A good monster collector/battle game !

It pains me because this game is absolutely stunning visually, and has a very large map, but the gameplay mechanics and rampant bugs just keep reminding you that this game needed more time in the oven and better testing.\n\nThis metroidvania has the worst double jump mechanic I have ever seen in any game in the genre to the point where it's borderline game ruining.  I don't even understand why we are reinventing such a simple mechanic that was solved over 25 years ago with Symphony of the Night.  You jump, then you jump again, anywhere!  It's just that easy.  Yet somehow the collective minds must have had to do some deep brainstorming to come up with such a terrible variation of something that should be so simple.\n\nIn this game, you can only double jump in certain sanctioned places and times.  Nothing breaks the natural flow of the game like having to file for a permit for the devs to be allowed to jump.  Ledge you can't reach?  OK, maybe we will let you double jump here, but not all the time.  What about those monsters camping a ledge next to you?  Sorry bro, your double jump permit has been revoked for this.  This gets more funny by the fact that you can unlock a triple jump that works even less.  Maybe instead of making players ask for permission to double jump unless it's raining on a Tuesday at lunch time, you just take the ball and chain off and make it like every metroidvania ever made because it worked.  It's like they made a decision to make the gameplay deliberately feel bad and clunky, and with how beautiful the game is, I can only liken it to having a high-end sports car then keying the side of it.\n\nAside from this, the game has no immunity frames when you take damage.  Nothing says fun like being stun-locked and juggled to death by 2 enemies because you are not in control of your character.  Again, this is something that was solved decades ago and somehow it didn't occur to anyone who tested this game that this makes combat feel infuriating.  At least you double jump over enemies...oh wait.\n\nThe UI is also needlessly cumbersome.  Again, most other games solved this decades ago by just letting the player press UP to interact with something, but as a KB+M player, an interaction wheel pops up at the bottom making me press 3?  Save points / portals also require you to press extra buttons to heal, and another one to bank your currency, both of which should obviously be automatic.  It's great when you jump through a warp to another area then die in 1 hit because you forgot to tell the save point to heal you.  Under what circumstance would I not want to be healed you have my currency saved?  This not only makes the UI feel bloated, but adds extra frustration to the player.  The game also requires you to press a button to \"confirm\" that a loading screen is done loading?  Just adding these UI hurdles for the player to jump over for no reason makes the game feel clunky so often.\n\nThere are also certain instances where my controls would just stop working, forcing me to restart the game.  In several instances I spawned through the floor in the hub area, and in one end game story segment forced me to restart a lengthy sequence from the start.  During the final boss, my block move would not work at all on phase 1, but magically on phase 2 against the literal same exact attacks.  This leads me to think the game was rushed out the door as the later areas of the game were prone to more bugs.\n\nIt's a shame because the game really is a stunning achievement visually, and the map is gorgeous in the surreal environments.  My hat's off to whoever designed the visuals for this game, it's best in genre perhaps with maybe FIST being the only other modern metroidvania that pulls this off.  But the worst double jump in history, clunky combat, annoying UI, and bugs just keep piling on constantly to pull you back from what should be a top tier metroidvania.  These things should be fixable with patches, if you are reading this and on the fence, check to see if patches have been released on the game's main page.

Well implemented. \n- I am happy that it is no longer Epic exclusive.\n- Although beta, i had the impression that the product is mostly complete.\n\nCons: \n- Graphichs are outdated.\n- I found the music lacking. Sound effects are far away from being satisfactory. Bare minimum at best.\n- 'Coming soon' for many races. Hell yea, this is where the gaming world is these days.\n- The intro movie as well as cutscenes look like they are from another game. There are some questionable design choices here regarding the the asset designs. Ships and stations in game look like toys of a six year old but the cutscenes show them as actual functional ships like we had in Homeworld series. Some players may like it but not my poison. Ship models do not show those mounted kinetic batteries, laser cannons, missile launchers or the modules you have found by exploration. \n- The combat part of the game is seriously lacking. It feels like stuffed plushies battling each other. Two groups of ships automaticly clash in space with no input from the player and the only thing you can decide is the number of the ships participating. All you see is blue lasers firing and puff...\n- The AI is not good at many things. Sending troop transports unescorted to occupy your planets and five to six ships arriving one by one as piecemeal instead of a decent fleet is common. I also find campaign AI very passive overall. An AI race was about to win during my playthrough and all other races did nothing like declaring war on the AI player to stop it from achieving total victory. I had to travel through two sectors to intervene myself. The year is 2023, stardock can do better.\n- There is not enough content to keep the player around like we had in similar games such as X4, Stellaris vice versa. Replayability is low.\n- AI claiming planets very far away from their core worlds is a broken mechanic which requires serious reconsideration.\n- Influence system of the game may require some tweaking as i have seen a poor level AI planet claiming almost 1/5 of the entire sector i was in. \n- The game has a lack of depth overall.\n- Beautifully presented premade races have zero voice acting for diplomacy screens.\n- Cultural progression has a ton of overwhelming options, however not meaningful. Most probably i would have the same result at the end of the game even without a single culture point invested. \n- Every time i started the game to reload an existing save, tutorial assistant was there. Please i do not want it as i have already visited the same screen many times. And yes i disabled the tutorial. \n- Strange bugs exist. I took out the hostiles occupying a ship graveyard, scanned it but the site did not disappear. When i visited it again, or AI visited it, i was unable to end the turn. It was annoying.\n\nConclusion: I do not recommend it. It is Galactic Civilization 4 released a year go in Epic renamed as 'Supernova', not a beta in my opinion. The money is very tight these days, what you will get for the price tag derpending on your region is maybe 15 hours of content which you will forget quickly and never visit again.

The game I joined was already in progress and enemies were bombarding us from mountain. And I believe many other issues have been addressed by other players as well (such as friends in specific team or teammates destroying your building or teammates stealing your army, etc).

I'm at a little over 20 hours, and I can say that it's definitely a farming sim you'll get your money's worth out of.  \n\nIn terms of familiar features, if you're familiar with titles like Stardew Valley, you'll notice an energy system, till, plant, water, harvest cycles, and mounts.  Some of the more hidden gems that I've found so far is a mastery system associated with each plant type, fish, and tree.  It seems as you get to a higher level, your chances for better quality harvest increases.\n\nNow... let's get the ugly bad over with.  The mini games are atrocious.  Seriously, I'd love the game immensely more if I wasn't forced through the same fishing mini game or pet taming ritual each and every time.  Second - while the teasers show irrigation, don't expect to get it early on.  Again 20+ hours and it's still eluding me.

The music is haunting and beautiful, and the sound effects are top-notch, with every footstep, creaking floorboard, and gust of wind sounding incredibly realistic.\n\nI love focus on narrative experience and puzzle-solving over flashy combat (which starts slow enough so you don't get overwhelmed by it and still seems to pick up the pace as you unlock more combat \"options\"). This is a game that rewards exploration and attention to detail, with a narrative that is revealed piece by piece as players explore the game world. The puzzles are expertly designed, ranging from simple challenges to brain-bending tests of logic and skill. Players will need to think outside the box and use all their wits to progress through the game's many challenges.\n\nAnd finally, let's talk about performance. Fox runs very well on a good PC (i'm rocking 1080ti and 13600k so maybe slightly above average setup), rock-solid 130 fps on max settings at 2560x1440p resolution. I have yet to notice any hiccups few hours in.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Last Case of Benedict Fox\" is an exceptional game that deserves to be played by anyone who loves immersive, story-driven games with a focus on exploration and puzzle-solving. The art style is unique and beautiful, the attention to detail is impressive, the sound design is top-notch, and the performance is exceptional.

This launch should be unacceptable, *especially* with the $70 price tag. The game is not a buggy unplayable mess, it's a fully finished game that they just didn't optimize for PC at all.
