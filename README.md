Repository for a group assignment for the "Advanced Analytics in a Big Data World" class at KU Leuven, 2nd semester 2022/2023.
Assignment 1: predictive modeling on tabular data
In this assignment, you will construct a predictive model to predict the "price per night" of Airbnb properties in Belgium.
Assignment 2: deep learning on images
In this assignment, you will work with image data (images from restaurants from the Michelin Guide) and deep learning.
Assignment 3: predicting on streamed textual data
The third assignment consists of the construction of a predictive model using Spark (Structured) Streaming and textual data. You will work with data coming from Steam, a popular platform for buying games. More precisely, you will work with reviews as they are posted for recently released games.

The goal of this assignment is threefold:

    1 - make sure you collect a historical set of data
    2 - construct a predictive model that can predict the score of a review based on its text (upvote or downvote)
    3 - show that your model can make predictions in a "deployed" setting on new reviews
Assignment 4: exploring graphs with Cypher and Gephi
our task for this assignment is to use Cypher queries and Gephi to analyze this data set.
You are free to explore anything you deem interesting and present your findings in your report. The
main goal is to get familiar with Cypher and Gephi, but also to hone your "storytelling" skills. In that sense,
try to focus on a single or a few hypotheses or findings you explore in full (with nicely formatted
visualizations) and explaining what it says instead of just going for quick filter saying: "here are the three
nodes with the most connections" (boring).
