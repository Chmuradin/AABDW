The two datasets "outliers.csv" and "no_outliers.csv" are constructed from "train.csv", filtered based
on whether or not the individual observations are flagged as outliers.

Outlier flagging is done via constructing applying:
IsolationForest(n_estimators=10000, bootstrap=True, n_jobs=-1, random_state=1), towards the dataset
