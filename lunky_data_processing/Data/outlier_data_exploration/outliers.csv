I am Jennifer!   If you are looking an apartment in Liege or Brussels, you are on the right page! No matter the length of your stay, we have a number of apartments to show you in either Liege or Brussels. Whether you are considering a romantic getaway, a family vacation or a business trip, we have what you need!   Most of our apartments are located in the heart of downtown, steps away from public transportation, shopping, bars and restaurants.  I happened to create Ze Agency’s after living a few years abroad. I wanted people to discover Belgium the way I know her and as local citizens.  I realized that living in an apartment is the perfect way to get used to a country, a neighborhood, and little local shops. It is the best way to feel at home! This is why, once back in 2009, I started Ze Agency.  What I particularly like about Ze Agency is the unique and human relationship I have with each member of the community.  The work environment is fantastic, authentic and very friendly. Once a week, we have breakfast together and talk about everything, from our little lives to the overall work. We want everyone to feel good and enjoy working in the agency.  We have an excellent relationship with our tenants.  Trust is everywhere: from their accommodations they happily entrusted to us to the reliable information they receive from us as experts of the market. We do our best to make their goods profitable. I’m quite sure they enjoy our services!  What I love about Liege is its convivial, caring, relax and festive side. Being “Liégeois” is a synonym for being a “party boy or girl”.  I love Brussels for is its international and multicultural side. Different languages can be heard during a day and you are certain to meet worldwide people on the city capital! This aspect can be seen in the melting pot of affordable restaurants in the city. Least but not last, a very friendly Belgian welcoming always present!  We are very much looking forward to sharing our great tips with you!  We hope that you will love your stay with us.

En descendant du Palais de Justice vers les Marolles par l’escalier et la rue de l’Epée, vous arriverez dans la rue des Renards. La rue pavée est extrêmement chaleureuse, remplie de bars accueillants et de petites terrasses agréables. Il n’est pas impossible de rencontrer une fanfare en passant d’une rue à l’autre. Au fil des années, le côté branché du quartier du Sablon s’est étendu jusqu’au Marolles qui fourmillent aujourd’hui de boutiques de décoration « Art Tribal » et d’antiquaires à la mode. L’une des rues les plus anciennes du quartier, la rue Haute, en est l’exemple le plus frappant. Elle a traversé le temps, depuis son tracé qui suit celui d’une ancienne voie gallo-romaine jusqu’à la porte de Hal, en absorbant la nouveauté des antiquaires qui ont peu à peu remplacé les commerces existants. Même scénario rue Blaes et même genre de trouvailles. Malgré tout, le quartier des Marolles n’a pas perdu ses racines.

I'm looking forward meeting you!","New renovated nice apartment with garden!  It is very good and centrally located in the middle of Antwerp. It is close to everything; shopping area, cultural & historical city center, restaurants and bars, public transport and train station, the zoo of Antwerp, the Antwerp opera house, the MAS museum, the south: Marnixplaats, Museum of Fine Arts... The apt. is on the ground floor with a garden. It is about 80 m2 of living place with open bedroom and another 12 m2 bathroom with a second toilet. There is no wall/door between bedroom and living-room which makes it cosy and light for your vacation.  So for longer term staying, the apartment is best for a couple (with small children) or for 2 people. You can enjoy my apartment with a Nespresso coffee and relax in the garden or go for breakfast, lunch or dinner just 100 m further to nice places.  I'm looking forward meeting you!",,,,,,,2018,51.2078225399608,4.403613523039496,Townhouse,Entire home/apt,4,1.0,1.0,2.0,Real Bed,"TV, Cable TV, Wireless Internet, Kitchen, Smoking allowed, Pets allowed, Heating, Family/kid friendly, Smoke detector, Fire extinguisher, Essentials, Shampoo, Hangers, Hair dryer, Iron, Private entrance, Hot water, Bed linens",2017-05-12,today,60756836,2016-02-28,"Antwerp, Flanders, Belgium",,within a day,77.0,3.0,3.0,"email, phone, facebook, jumio, government_id",2,2,1125,30,60,90,180,flexible,0,,,,,,,,,,,"Host Has Profile Pic, Host Identity Verified",55
